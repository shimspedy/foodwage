ingredients:
- Turkey Bolognese With Zucchini Noodles:

- 1|  tbsp  olive oil
- 0.25|  cup  onion  chopped
- 1|  stalk celery  finely chopped
- 2|  small carrots  minced
- ground turkey
- canned diced tomatoes with juices
- 0.25|  cup  Parmesan cheese  optional, for serving
- 4|  medium  zucchini
directions:
- Set a medium pot over medium-high heat and pour in the olive oil, heat for a few seconds before adding the onions. Stir, cooking for about 5 minutes, then add the celery and carrots. When they start to sizzle, reduce the heat to low and cook for about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally.
- When the carrots are softened and the onions are golden, add the turkey. Raise the heat to medium-high. Stir, breaking up the turkey into small bits as it browns. Cook until the turkey is cooked through and no pink remains. Add the diced tomatoes and stir, cooking until the pan is nearly dry, about 10 minutes.
- Spiralize the zucchini and divide among four plates. Top each serving of zucchini noodles with about 1 cup of sauce.

If you haven’t tried zucchini noodles yet, now’s the time. Spiralizers are available in affordable countertop versions, as well as handheld peelers that churn out spaghetti-shaped strips of zucchini, carrots or whatever your heart desires. Zucchini is popular, because it’s easy to cut and neutral enough to stand in for spaghetti, without all the carbs.
