Fresh herbs turn a couple of pantry basics into a beautiful glaze for chicken. This Cooking Light recipe takes healthy grilled chicken one step further adding extra sweetness and flavor with an apricot-rosemary glaze. It is then served on a fragrant bed of parsley-almond couscous. If your mouth isnâ€™t watering yet it will be!
