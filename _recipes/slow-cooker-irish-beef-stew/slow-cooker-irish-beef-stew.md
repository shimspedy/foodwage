directions:
- Sprinkle stew meat with salt and toss till well combined. Using a fork, prick the meat in multiple places to tenderize. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, but ideally refrigerate overnight.
- Toss the meat with flour. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and then sear meat until browned on the outside.
- While meat is browning, mix together tomato paste, soy sauce, beef stock (use more if you like it more soupy than stewy) and Guinness & red wine (if using) in slow cooker.
- Transfer meat (browned or not) to slow cooker. Add garlic, onions, carrots, potatoes, bay leaves, and black pepper.
- Cook on low for 6 to 7 hours or high for 3 to 4 until meat is falling apart and tender.
