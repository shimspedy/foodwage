ingredients:
- Mexican Burrito with Chicken & Avocado:

- precooked or leftover chicken breasts
- 0.25|  cup  fresh or frozen corn  cooked or thawed
- 0.25|  cup  no salt added black beans  drained and rinsed
- 2|  tablespoon  finely chopped cilantro  divided (plus more for optional garnish)
- 0.5|  cup  shredded reduced-sodium Cheddar cheese
- 1|  small  avocado  diced and divided
- 0.25|  cup  low-sodium tomatillo salsa  divided (plus more for optional garnish)
- 1|  teaspoon  lime juice
- Salt and pepper  to taste
- 3|  medium  whole-wheat flour tortillas  8-inch
- Diced tomatoes  optional garnish

directions:
- Heat the chicken strips according to package directions. Once warm, chop chicken into bite-size pieces.
- In a small bowl, combine chicken, corn, black beans, 1 tablespoon cilantro, cheese, 1/2 avocado and 2 tablespoons salsa. Mix well to combine. Add salt and pepper, to taste. In a blender or food processor, combine lime juice, and the remaining avocado, salsa and cilantro. Blend until creamy. Taste for seasoning, adding more lime juice or salt as needed.
- Spread 1/3 chicken filling into the center of a flour tortilla. Fold in the sides, and bring up the bottom of the tortilla, tucking in the ends. Keep rolling, pressing and creasing the end of the tortilla as you finish rolling it up. Top with avocado cream, and, if desired, more salsa, cilantro and tomatoes.

Why buy burritos when theyâ€™re so simple to make? Save time with precooked chicken (you can also use leftovers!) and budget-friendly staples like canned beans, shredded cheese, salsa and frozen corn. Then, step up your burrito game by adding creamy avocado and fresh lime juice. Wrap in foil, and pack for a homemade lunch.
