ingredients:
- Pasta Lentil Bolognese:

- 2|  teaspoon  olive oil
- 1|  medium onion,  diced small
- 1|  medium carrot  peeled and diced small
- 2|  small celery stalks  diced small
- 1|  small fennel bulb  diced small
- 4|  cloves garlic  minced
- 2|  tablespoon  white wine vinegar
- 2|  cup  low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1|  cup  green lentils
- 2.5|  cup  jarred or tetra-packed  no-salt-added, chopped or crushed tomatoes with juices
- 2|  teaspoon  dried oregano
- 2|  teaspoon  dried parsley
- 1|  teaspoon  dried basil
- wide whole-wheat pasta noodles such as linguine, fettuccine, tagliatelle or rigatoni
- 0.5|  cup  low-fat milk
- 0.25|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.5|  teaspoon  ground black pepper

directions:
- In a large Dutch oven or saucepan, heat oil on medium-high. Add onion, carrot, celery, fennel and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until released water evaporates and brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pot, about 15 minutes. Add vinegar, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pot as the liquid evaporates. Stir in the broth, 1 cup water, lentils, tomatoes, oregano, parsley and basil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and prepare pasta according to package directions. Drain pasta and set aside.
- Add milk to Bolognese and continue to simmer for an additional 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Divide pasta among 4 bowls and top each with about 1.5 cups Bolognese.

Bolognese is a rich ragu that simmers for hours, coaxing flavor from aromatic vegetables. Clean Eatingâ€™s plant-based, lentil bolognese honors its roots with steady (thankfully quicker!) preparation that gets its rich flavor from caramelized vegetables.
