notes:

- 
ingredients:
- Puree:

- 1| cup mango chopped
- 1| tsp fresh lime juice

- pancakes:

- 0.25| cup coconut flour
- 0.25| teaspoon baking powder
- 0.5| cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk
- 1| tablespoon coconut oil melted
- 1| tablespoon maple syrup optional
- 3| large egg whites
- 1| teaspoon vanilla

directions:
- Place the mango and lime juice in a blender and puree until smooth, scraping sides and repeating as needed. Pour into a small bowl.
- In a large bowl, combine the coconut flour and baking powder, whisk to combine. In a medium bowl, combine the almond milk, coconut oil, maple syrup, egg whites and vanilla and whisk vigorously for 1 minute to really incorporate the egg whites.
- Preheat a griddle or large non-stick pan over medium heat.
- Stir the egg white mixture into the coconut flour mixture. It will thicken as you stir. When well-mixed, it should be pourable but thick. If it is too thick, stir in another tablespoon of almond milk.
- Coat the hot pan with coconut-oil spray. Scoop heaping 0.25-cup (72g) portions and drop on the oiled pan, spreading into 4-inch rounds. Cook for about 2–3 minutes on the first side, until the edges look cooked and the top is bubbly. Carefully turn the cakes and cook for another 2 minutes, until puffed in the center and cooked through.

If you’re craving pancakes, but not the carb overload, these gluten-free, lower-carb cakes are a great option. They’re tender and tasty, and subbing naturally sweet mango topping for the syrup makes them seem decadent — with fewer grams of added sugar. Coconut flour is naturally sweet-tasting, too.
