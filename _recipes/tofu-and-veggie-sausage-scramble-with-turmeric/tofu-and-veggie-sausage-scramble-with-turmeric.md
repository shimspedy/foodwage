- 
ingredients:
- Scramble:

- 12| oz firm nigari tofu drained
- 0.25| cup rolled oats
- 1| cup carrot shredded
- 2| medium scallions chopped
- 1| tsp turmeric
- 4| Morningstar Farms Breakfast Veggie Sausages chopped
- 1| cup cherry tomato halved
- 2| cup baby spinach chopped
directions:
- Drain the tofu and wrap in a thick kitchen towel. Press out excess water by placing a heavy pot on top for about 10 minutes. Unwrap and crumble the tofu into a large bowl. Add the oats and stir. Add the carrots, scallions and turmeric and mix well.
- Coat a large, non-stick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Add the chopped sausages. Stir for 30 seconds or so, then add the tofu mixture and stir. Scrape and stir until the tofu is browned in spots, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes and stir for a minute, until softened and heated through. Add the spinach and stir just until wilted, then serve.

Tofu is an inexpensive, high-protein, low-fat food that deserves a place at your table. This easy scramble delivers 23% of your daily iron requirement on top of being a savory, hearty breakfast with a generous serving of vegetables on every plate. Since vegetarian sources of iron arenâ€™t as well absorbed as meat sources, add a source of vitamin C like a bell pepper to maximize absorption.
