Savor meatless Monday with this lentil sweet potato & spinach stew from Elle. Lentils provide a great source of protein and iron for vegetarians and vegans, and add so much body to this stew. The orange veggies add the perfect amount of sweet to balance the spice without a pinch of added sugar. This stew can be made ahead of time and frozen for convenient reheating.
