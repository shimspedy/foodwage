Baking a whole chicken doesn’t have to be an intimidating task. In fact, it only requires 10 ingredients and takes less than 30 minutes thanks to a pressure cooker. According to Love & Zest, the magic formula is cooking the chicken for 6 minutes per pound. So for this recipe, which uses a 3 1/2 pound chicken, the cook time is 21 minutes. For an even juicier bird, set it on a wire trivet so the skin gets extra crispy. You’ll have a flavorful, protein-packed dish to feed the whole family dinner in no time.
