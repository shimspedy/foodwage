ingredients:
- Baked Peach BBQ Chicken Wings:

- 1.5| pounds chicken wings
- salt

- For Peach BBQ Marinade:

- 1|  cup  peeled and chopped peaches  about 1 1/2 large peaches
- 0.25|  cup tomato sauce  plus 2 tablespoons
- 2|  teaspoon  double-concentrated tomato paste
- 0.5|  cup  unsweetened apple cider  plus 2 tablespoons
- 2|  tablespoon  fish sauce  plus 1 1/2 teaspoons , certified gluten-free if necessary
- 2|  tablespoon  reduced-sodium soy sauce  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 1|  teaspoon  chili powder
- 1|  teaspoon  ground cumin
- 0.75|  teaspoon  onion powder
- 0.5|  teaspoon  granulated garlic
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt

directions:
- Chop the chicken wings into three pieces, along the joints. Keep the 2 meatier sections for the baked wings. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over them. Set aside. (You can reserve the wing tips for making chicken stock or discard them.)
- Blend the marinade ingredients in a blender until smooth. Pour the marinade into a bowl. Add the chicken wings, and mix everything together. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.
- Preheat oven to 375°F (190ºC). Line a baking sheet with foil. Place an oven-safe wire rack on top of the pan. Brush oil on the rack to prevent wings from sticking.
- Shake excess sauce from the wings, and place them on the rack. Save the marinade. Bake wings for 25 minutes.
- While the wings are baking, cook the leftover marinade in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Once it boils, reduce the heat to medium-low, and let it simmer for 8–10 minutes, until the sauce thickens. (You should see small bubbles in the sauce.) Turn off the heat, and use this as the basting sauce.
- After 25 minutes, baste the wings, flip them over and baste the other side.
- Bake for another 17 minutes. Baste wings again, flip and baste the other side.
- Bake for another 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, and remove the wings from the oven. Brush additional sauce on the wings.
- Let the wings rest for a few minutes before serving. Refrigerate leftovers for 4–5 days.
