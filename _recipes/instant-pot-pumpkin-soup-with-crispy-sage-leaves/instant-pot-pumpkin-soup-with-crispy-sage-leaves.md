ingredients:
- Instant Pot Pumpkin Soup With Crispy Sage Leaves:

- 2|  tbsp  olive oil or ghee
- 2|  tsp  chopped fresh sage  plus 12 whole sage leaves
- 1|  medium  onion  sliced
- 1|  medium  carrot  chopped
- 3|  medium  garlic cloves  chopped
- 1|  tsp  fresh rosemary  chopped
- 4|  heaping cup  ugar pumpkin or butternut squash cubes 1-inch/2.5cm
- 4|  cup  low-sodium chicken broth
- 1|  bay leaf
- 0.75|  tsp  salt
- 0.25|  tsp  pepper

directions:
- Put the oil in the pot, select SAUTÉ, and adjust to MORE/HIGH heat. When the oil is hot, add the whole sage leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leaves are crisp and lightly browned, 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl with a slotted spoon and set aside for garnish, leave the oil in the pot.
- Add the onions and carrots to the pot and cook, stirring frequently, until they begin to brown, 8 minutes. Add the chopped sage, garlic and rosemary and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Press CANCEL.
- Add the squash, broth and bay leaf. Lock the lid, select the PRESSURE COOK function and adjust to high pressure for 10 minutes. Make sure the steam valve is in the sealing position and that the Keep Warm function is turned off.
- When the cooking time is up, quick-release the pressure. Discard the bay leaf. Blend the soup with a stick blender or in batches in a blender with the lid slightly ajar and towel over the top to prevent splatters. Season the soup with salt and pepper. Garnish with the fried sage leaves crumbled over the top of each bowl.

This silky-smooth squash soup cooks in just 10 minutes in the Instant Pot, so it’s quick enough for a weeknight. The soup is garnished with crispy, fried sage leaves, making it fancy enough for dinner, too. For an extra-rich meal, substitute ghee for the olive oil when frying the sage.
