notes:


ingredients:
- Brussels Sprouts Hash with Bacon & Egg:

- 2|  slices  center-cut bacon  cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- Brussels sprouts  quartered
- 1|  shallot, quartered lengthwise and halved crosswise
- 0.5|  teaspoon  kosher salt  divided, plus more to taste
- Black pepper  to taste
- 2|  large  eggs

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425°F.
- Heat a 12-inch cast iron or ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring, until crisp, 3–4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a plate lined with a paper towel.
- Roast until the sprouts have softened but still have bite, 6–8 minutes.
- Meanwhile, heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat lightly with cooking spray, and crack the eggs into the skillet. Cover and cook until the eggs are set, about 2 minutes, or to your desired doneness.
- Divide the sprouts between two plates, and top each with an egg. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
