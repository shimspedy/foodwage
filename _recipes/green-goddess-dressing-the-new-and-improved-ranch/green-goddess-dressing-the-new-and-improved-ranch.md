Remember when “do it yourself” ranch dressings were all the rage and required a special shaker with a green lid and a powder you added mayonnaise and buttermilk to?
These days, making your own dressings with a few simple ingredients is the name of the game, powders are suspect, and ranch — while it will be forever in our hearts — is stepping aside for healthier, herbier options.
Enter the Green Goddess — with coconut milk and avocado making the swap for mayo and lime juice standing in for buttermilk as the tart kick, this dippable, spreadable, craveable dressing is the perfect accompaniment to salads and sides. Dollop it on grain bowls, toss it with salads, spread it on sandwiches and toasts or stir it into noodles. The coconut milk and avocado bring healthy fats, while the herbs and lime are all-natural flavor enhancers that are bright, rich and exciting.
True, there will always be places where ranch just “belongs;” on chicken wings for sure, and with buttermilk biscuits and fried chicken (but we don’t think fried chicken would mind if it was paired with Green Goddess at your next ‘que.)
