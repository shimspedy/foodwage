notes:

ingredients:
- tortillas:

- 2|  cup  White Whole Wheat Flour
- 3|  tablespoons  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 0.75|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.66666666666|  cup  warm Water

directions:
- In a bowl, mix together the flour, oil and salt. Slowly add the warm water while stirring until a rough dough comes together. Add a little extra water if needed. Turn the dough onto the counter and knead for about two minutes. Return to bowl and let rest for 20 minutes.
- Divide dough into 8 equal balls. Using a rolling pin, roll each ball into a circle. You’ll want them to be pretty thin.
- Heat a pan over medium high heat and grease very lightly. Drop one tortilla into the pan and let cook until bubbles form, about 1 minute. Flip over and cook another minute, pressing down with a spatula if needed. Repeat with remaining dough.
- Use immediately, or store in an airtight container and either refrigerate or freeze. Warm just before serving to soften.
