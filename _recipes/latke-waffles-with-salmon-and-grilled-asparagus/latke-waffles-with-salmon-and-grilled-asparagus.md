- 
ingredients:
- Latke Waffles With Salmon and Grilled Asparagus:

- russet or sweet potatoes  peeled and grated
- 2|  eggs  beaten
- 0.25|  cup  chopped green onions
- 0.33333333333|  cup  all-purpose or gluten-free flour
- 0.5|  tsp  baking powder
- 0.25|  tsp  salt
- asparagus  tough ends snapped off
- 2|  tsp  olive oil
- 0.25|  tsp  ground black pepper
- 2|  tsp  lemon juice
- smoked salmon, flaked
- 0.5|  cup  plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
- 0.25|  cup  fresh dill,  roughly chopped

directions:
- Preheat oven to 250°F (120°C). Preheat a waffle maker to medium. Place the grated potato in a large, clean dish towel. Twist the ends and squeeze to remove excess moisture. Combine the potato, eggs and green onions in a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add to the potato mixture and stir until no traces of dry flour remain.
- Generously spray the top and bottom of waffle maker with the cooking spray. Spoon half of the sweet potato mixture into the waffle maker and close the lid gently; cook for 2 minutes, steam will escape out the sides as the mixture heats up. (If using a smaller Belgian waffle maker, cook the batter in four batches, spraying with cooking spray between batches.) Press the top of the waffle maker down firmly and continue to cook until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Transfer the waffle to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while making the remaining waffle(s).
- Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Toss the asparagus with the oil and pepper and grill, turning once, until just tender, 4 minutes. Toss with the lemon juice.
- To serve, arrange the asparagus and salmon over the waffles. Top with dollops of yogurt and a sprinkle of dill.

This recipe makes crispy latke goodness as easy as heating up your waffle maker. Use the grating attachment on a food processor or spiralizer to make quick work of the prep — whether you have russet potatoes or sweet potatoes. For the crispest results, squeeze the excess moisture from the veg and be generous with the cooking spray when preparing the waffle iron.
