time: under 50mins # under 60mins under 120mins over 120mins
servings: 6 

ingredients:
- 2| blocks extra firm tofu *28 oz*
- 2| tablespoons olive oil
- 0.25| cup quinoa flour
- 0.5| cup nutritional yeast
- 1| tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 1| teaspoon dried garlic
- 1| teaspoon dried sage
- 0.25| tsp smoked paprika
-  salt & pepper to taste

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF.
- Cut the tofu into steaks, about 1/2" thick. Each block should get you about 6 steaks. Set aside.
- In shallow bowl or dish, whisk together the dry ingredients.
- Now, set up your assembly line! Put the olive oil in another shallow dish. First, coat a tofu steak in oil. Then place the tofu in the bowl of the dry ingredients and coat the tofu with the dry mixture. Place the steak on a baking sheet and repeat with the rest of the tofu.
- When ready to bake, place the baking sheet in the oven. Cook for 15 minutes, then flip and cook for another 15 - 20. You want the tofu to be golden brown and crispy.
- Serve tofu with your favorite sauce (I love a garlic tahini sauce!) and your favorite vegetable side dish. Enjoy!
