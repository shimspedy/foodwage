time: under 15 mins
servings: 6

notes:
- The key to a perfect crisp is a sparing amount of cooking spray so that extra fat doesn’t absorb into the quesadilla. Plus, spreading mashed beans onto each tortilla forms a protective layer that keeps the veggie juices contained (and the tortillas crisp).

ingredients:
- Quesadilla:

- 1| teaspoon canola oil
- 1| cup  coarsely chopped poblano chile
- 0.5| cup frozen whole-kernel corn
- 0.75| cup  packaged precooked quinoa and brown rice  (such as Seeds of Change)
- 0.25| teaspoon salt
- 5| ounces fresh spinach  teaspoon
- 3| ounces sharp cheddar cheese  shredded (about 3/4 cup)
- 1| cup canned unsalted black beans  rinsed and drained
- 2| teaspoons Mexican hot sauce  cup
- 8| flour tortillas  (6-inch)
- Cooking spray

- Optional Garnishes:

- 6| tablespoons light sour cream
- 6| lime wedges

directions:
- Place oven rack in middle of oven. Preheat broiler to high. Place a baking sheet on rack in oven (keep pan in oven as it preheats).
- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add poblano and corn; cook 5 minutes, stirring once. Add quinoa, salt, and spinach; sauté 2 minutes or until spinach wilts. Remove from heat; stir in cheese.
- Combine beans and hot sauce in a small bowl; mash with fork until smooth. Spread 2.5 tablespoons bean mixture on each of 4 tortillas; top each with 0.5 cup spinach mixture and 1 tortilla. Lightly coat quesadillas with cooking spray. Arrange quesadillas on preheated pan in oven; broil 3 minutes or until lightly browned, turning once.
