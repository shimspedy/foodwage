ingredients:
- Matcha Coconut Cake With Lime Glaze:

- 0.25|  cup  unsalted butter  at room temperature
- 1|  cup  sugar
- 1|  tbsp  fresh lime zest
- 2|  eggs  at room temperature
- 0.25|  cup  Greek yogurt or full-fat coconut yogurt
- 0.75|  cup  whole-fat coconut milk
- 1.5|  cup  unbleached all-purpose flour  or your favorite gluten-free substitute
- 0.25|  tsp  blanched almond flour
- 2|  tbsp  matcha green tea powder
- 0.75|  tsp  baking powder
- 1|  tsp  fine-grain sea salt

- For the glaze:

- 1.66666666666|  cup  powdered sugar
- 2|  tbsp  fresh lime juice
- 1|  tsp  lime zest

directions:
- For the cake - Preheat oven to 350°F (177ºC). Prepare a 9.5 inch by 4.25 inch loaf pan by lightly greasing the bottom with coconut oil, then fit with a piece of parchment paper. Set the pan aside.
- For the cake -In a bowl, combine the flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt, matcha powder and whisk to combine, set aside. In another small bowl, stir the coconut milk and yogurt until smooth, then set aside.
- For the cake - In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, sugar and lime zest until light in color and very fluffy, about 2 minutes on high speed. Add eggs one at a time, making sure not to add the next egg until the first is completely incorporated, and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the coconut milk and yogurt to the butter mixture, then add half of the flour, beating it on medium high until just combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and add the rest of the flour mixture, beating until just combined.
- For the cake - Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan and even out with an offset spatula. Bake in preheated oven for 45–50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean and the top of the cake is slightly golden. When touched gently with a finger, the top will spring back easily (instead of making an indentation). Once removed from the oven, loosen the sides from the pan with a sharp knife and flip carefully onto a cooling rack, being sure the cake top is facing up. Cool completely (about 1 hour), then pour the glaze over the top.
- For the glaze - Sift the powdered sugar, then add the lime juice and zest. Whisk until the sugar is combined. It should be thick, but not too thick; it should pour easily.

Matcha is definitely having a moment these days with its energizing, antioxidant-filled properties. And the powdered green tea gives this moist, not-too-sweet, not-too-rich cake an elf-like hue that makes it the unexpected star of any special spread.
