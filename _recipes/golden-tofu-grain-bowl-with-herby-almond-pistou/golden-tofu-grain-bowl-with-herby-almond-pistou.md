notes: 
- The tofu can be made three days ahead. Cool completely and store in an airtight container in the fridge.

ingredients:
-  For the tofu :
- 340| g block firm tofu
- 2| tbsp Bragg’s Liquid Aminos
- 1| tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 2| tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar
- 0.5| tsp crushed red pepper
- 3.81| cm tsp piece ginger, grated
- 1| tbsp olive oil
- 1| tbsp sesame oil
- 1| tbsp cornstarch
- For the pistou :
- 75| g almonds
- 2| garlic cloves, finely grated
- 6| cup  mixed fresh herbs *about 3 bunches* basil, parsley, cilantro, mint
- 177| ml olive oil
- 1| tablespoon kosher salt
- For the grain bowl :
- 185| g cooked quinoa
- 2| carrots, thinly shaved
- 1| cucumber, thinly sliced
- 10| g radish sprouts
- 2| cips baby spinach
- 1|  teaspoon each poppy seeds, sesame seeds and hemp seeds



directions:
- Drain tofu, then sandwich between several layers of kitchen towels to remove excess liquid; allow to sit for 10–20 minutes. Cut into 32 small cubes.
- Whisk soy sauce, maple syrup, rice vinegar, crushed red pepper and ginger in a small bowl. Add the tofu and toss to coat. Then, sprinkle with cornstarch and toss to coat evenly.
- Drain any liquid not absorbed by the tofu, then transfer the tofu to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake in a 375°F (190ºC) oven for 20–30 minutes, shaking the pan halfway through, until golden brown, crispy and fragrant.
- While the tofu is baking, make the pistou.
- Lower the oven temp to 350°F *180ºC*.
- Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once halfway through, until golden and fragrant, 5–7 minutes.
- Transfer to a food processor and let cool. Add garlic and pulse until finely ground, about 1 minute.
- Add herbs and replace the top.
- With the motor running, add oil in a slow and steady stream until pistou is mostly smooth, with just a few flecks of green, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt.
- To assemble the bowl, divide the grains, spinach, carrots, cucumbers and sprouts between two bowls. Divide the tofu between bowls, and top with a dollop of pesto. Sprinkle with mixed seeds and enjoy.
- Pistou can be made a day ahead. Top with 1/2-inch oil to prevent browning. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto surface, and chill.
