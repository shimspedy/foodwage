servings: 8

notes:
- Add additional liquid when reheating leftovers of the soup as the orzo pasta will absorb additional liquid. Soup can be frozen for up to 3 months in freezer bags in 2 cup portions.
- If you are using leftover shredded turkey (about 3 cups is recommended), add the cooked meat during the last 5-7 minutes of cooking.
ingredients:
- Turkey Orzo Soup:
- 1|  large  white onion
- 4|  medium  carrots
- 4|  medium  stalks celery hearts
- 2|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 4|  cloves of garlic
- turkey breast cutlets  if using cooked turkey, see note below
- 10|  cup  chicken broth
- 1.5|  cup  dry orzo pasta
- 0.25|  cup  lemons, juiced
- 2|  tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

directions:
- Dice onion, carrots, and celery hearts. You should get about 2 cups diced onion, and 1.5 cups each of diced carrots and celery.
- In a soup pot, add diced vegetables along with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sauté for 5 minutes on medium heat.
- Mince garlic cloves and add them to the pot, sauteing for 2 minutes.
- Add in turkey breast cutlets (thinly sliced raw turkey breast), broth, and dry pasta. Bring the soup to a simmer, and then allow it to cook for 15-20 minutes.
- Test the orzo pasta for doneness before turning off the heat. Remove the turkey meat and shred it using 2 forks, and then return it to the pot.
- Add in the lemon juice and fresh parsley. Stir to combine, and serve hot in 2 cup portions.
