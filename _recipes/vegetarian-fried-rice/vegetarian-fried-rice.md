meal: breakfast
chef: foodwage
time: under 30 mins
servings: 6

notes:
- Cook the rice a day in advance and refrigerate to cut down on prep work the following day. Stir-fry ingredients should be cut to a uniform small size so they cook evenly and quickly, and they should be dry so they don’t create steam.

ingredients:
- stir-fry sauce:

- 2.5| tablespoons soy sauce  or to taste (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 1| tablespoon  hoisin sauce  (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- to taste  Freshly ground pepper

- fried tofu:

- 0.5| tablespoon vegetable oil
- 6| ounces  firm tofu  cut into 1/4 inch cubes and blotted dry with paper towels
- to taste  Salt
- to taste  freshly ground pepper

- egg pancake strips:

- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 large egg  lightly beaten

- stir-fry:

- 1.5| teaspoons vegetable oil
-  1| small onion  finely diced
- 1| tablespoon minced garlic
- 1| tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
- 6| cups  cooked brown rice  (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 2| teaspoons  toasted sesame oil
- 0.5| cup  thinly sliced green beans
- 0.5| cup  very thinly sliced or cubed carrots
- 0.5| cup  frozen corn  thawed
- to taste  Salt
- to taste  freshly ground pepper
- 1  Pinch red pepper flakes

directions:
- To make the sauce, in a small bowl, mix the ingredients until well combined; set aside.  
- To make the fried tofu, line a large plate with paper towels. In a very large nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Season the tofu with salt and pepper, then sauté it, turning frequently, until lightly browned on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to the prepared plate and set aside. (Do not rinse the skillet.)
- To make the egg pancake strips for the garnish, return the skillet to medium-low heat and add the vegetable oil. Brush it over the bottom, then add the egg and swirl to thinly coat the pan, as you would for a very thin pancake. Cook until firm, about 45 seconds, then flip the egg like a pancake and cook the other side until firm. Transfer to a large plate and dab with paper towels to remove any grease. Set the skillet aside. When the egg is cool, roll it up and slice it into thin strips; set aside.
- To make the stir-fry, return the skillet to medium-high heat and heat the vegetable oil. Add the onions and sauté for 1 minute. Add the garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute, then add the rice and increase the heat to high. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until the rice is heated through.
- Push the rice to one side of the skillet and add the sesame oil to the empty space. Add the green beans, carrots, and corn and sauté, stirring, until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Add the scallions and sauté for 1 minute, then mix the vegetables with the rice. Make a well in the center of the rice, add the reserved sauce, and stir until it boils, then add the tofu and mix everything again. Season with salt, pepper, and pepper flakes, if using, garnish with the reserved egg pancake strips, and serve promptly.
