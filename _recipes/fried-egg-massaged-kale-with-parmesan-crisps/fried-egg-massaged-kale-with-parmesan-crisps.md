- Measure 1 tablespoon of parmesan cheese and place it in a pile on a baking sheet. Repeat for remaining cheese and bake for 5 to 8 minutes, or until browned and crispy.
- Allow parmesan crisps to sit on the hot baking sheet a couple of minutes before gently peeling them off of the parchment. Use your hands to break the parmesan crisps up into small bits for adding to the salad.
- Then, prepare the salad by adding the raw (or blanched) chopped kale to a medium-sized serving bowl.
- In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, mustard, and salt until well-combined. Pour the dressing over the kale and toss until everything is well coated.
- Add the parmesan crisps and serve with a poached, fried, or sunny side up egg.
