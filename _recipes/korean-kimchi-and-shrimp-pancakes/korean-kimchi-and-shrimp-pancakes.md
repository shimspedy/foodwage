ingredients:
- For the pancakes:

- 0.75|  cup  all-purpose flour
- 1|  egg  beaten
- 1|  pinch  salt
- 8|  ounces  shrimp  peeled, deveined and roughly chopped
- 0.5|  cup  Napa cabbage kimchi  drained and chopped
- 1|  large  carrot  peeled and grated
- 3|  green onions  thinly sliced
- 2|  tablespoon  canola oil

- For the dipping sauce:

- 2|  tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce or coconut aminos
- 2|  tablespoon  unseasoned rice vinegar
- 1|  teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
- 1|  small clove  garlic  finely chopped

directions:
- Preheat oven to 250°F. Place the flour in a medium bowl. Add 0.75 cups of water, the egg and a pinch of salt. Whisk until smooth. Fold in the shrimp, kimchi, carrots and green onions. Set aside for 5 minutes.
- In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and garlic. Pour into 4 dipping bowls and set aside.
- Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour 0.5 cup of the batter into the pan and spread it out into a 5–6-inch pancake.
- Cook the pancakes until the edges are set and the bottom is golden brown, 5 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and cooked through (the centers will be set but still moist), about 3 minutes. Place the pancakes on a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while cooking the remaining pancakes. Cook the remaining pancakes, adding the remaining oil, if necessary.
- Cut the pancakes into wedges and serve with the dipping sauce.

These savory Korean pancakes have crispy edges and a moist interior full of crunchy vegetables and tender bits of shrimp. The kimchi flavor is subtle, so even kimchi haters should like these.
