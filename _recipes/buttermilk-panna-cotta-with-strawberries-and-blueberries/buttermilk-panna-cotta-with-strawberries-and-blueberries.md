ingredients:
- Buttermilk Panna Cotta With Strawberries and Blueberries:

- 1.25|  cup  low-fat milk
- 1.5|  teaspoon  plain gelatin
- 0.33333333333|  cup  sugar  plus 1 teaspoon
- 1|  vanilla pod
- 1.75|  cup  buttermilk
- 2|  teaspoon  rose water  optional
- 1|  cup  sliced strawberries
- 1|  cup  blueberries

directions:
- Spray 6 (6-ounce) ramekins with cooking spray, set aside. Pour 0.25 cup (59ml) of the milk into a small bowl. Add the gelatin and stir to combine. Set aside for 10 minutes.
- In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining cup of (237ml) milk and 0.33333333333 cup (67g) of the sugar. Cut the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and use a butter knife to scrape out the sticky black seeds. Add them and the scraped vanilla pod to the milk mixture. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar has dissolved and the milk is hot to the touch, 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the gelatin mixture and whisk until smooth.
- Add the buttermilk and rose water into the pan and whisk to combine. Ladle the mixture into the prepared ramekins. Refrigerate until set, about 6 hours. In a small bowl, toss the strawberries with the remaining teaspoon of sugar. Chill until needed.
- Run a knife around the edge of each ramekin. Place a dessert plate on top of each ramekin and invert, releasing the panna cotta onto the plate. Spoon the strawberries over the top of the panna cotta and garnish with the blueberries.

The rose water in this creamy, low-calorie, low sugar, fruit-packed dessert adds a subtle, exotic flavor but itâ€™s optional. Look for it wherever Middle Eastern ingredients are sold or order it online. Rose water lasts indefinitely and is a lovely addition to citrus salads and your morning yogurt.
