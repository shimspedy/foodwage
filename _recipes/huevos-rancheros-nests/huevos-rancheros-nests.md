servings: 4

notes:

ingredients:
- Tortillas:

- 1.5| tsp Olive Oil 4|

- Filling:

- 0.5| cup chopped yellow onion 1.25|
- 1| medium garlic clove, diced 1|
- 4| large eggs 0.5|
- 0.25| cup crumbled feta cheese 2|

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F (190ºC). Spray four 10-ounce (295ml) oven-safe ramekins with cooking spray and place on a small baking sheet.
- Wrap tortillas in plastic wrap (or use the bag they came in) and microwave until pliable, 25 seconds. (Alternatively heat the tortillas over medium heat in a nonstick pan.)
- Brush both sides of the tortillas with 1.5 teaspoons of oil and gently push the tortillas into the ramekins (the tortilla will overlap on itself in places, this is fine); set aside.
- Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a medium sauté pan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until lightly browned, 3 minutes. Add garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant, 20 seconds. Add the beans and 0.75 cup water, mash with a potato masher and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 3 minutes.
- Spoon the beans into the tortilla shells. Crack an egg into each ramekin, spoon the salsa over the eggs, and sprinkle with cheese and green onions. Bake the ramekins until the egg white and top of the yolks are set, 12–15 minutes for runny yolks, 20 minutes for yolks that are nearly set; serve immediately.

Tortillas make the perfect nests to hold beans and eggs in this clever spin on the much-loved Mexican breakfast. Making your own refried beans takes just minutes, and you’ll cut out a lot of the sodium and fat found in canned versions.
