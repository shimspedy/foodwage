It’s easy to get into a sugar crash after breakfast. Between the coffee, banana, bagel and other quick fixes we grab in the morning where else can we squeeze in the fat and protein that adds balance to the meal? Here’s a sugar-proof idea from our Elle Penner: poached egg and crispy prosciutto avocado toast. It takes a little prep work but only 7 minutes to put together.
