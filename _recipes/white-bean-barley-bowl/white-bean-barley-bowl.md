This vegetarian-friendly grain bowl is packed with fiber from the plump corn and pearled barley. It’s lightly seasoned with lemon and dill for full flavor, and can be paired with a source of lean protein for a complete lunch. If you don’t like pearled barley, you can also make this recipe using a whole grain of your choice (like brown rice).
