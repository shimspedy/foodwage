ingredients:
- Sweet Potato Brownies:

- 1|  medium sweet potato
- 2|  eggs
- 0.5|  cup  almond butter
- 0.33333333333|  cup  almond meal finely ground almonds
- 0.33333333333|  cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
- 0.25|  teaspoon  baking soda
- 0.125|  teaspoon  salt
- 59|  cup  cacao nibs, mini chocolate chips or chopped nuts optional

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425°F. Wrap the sweet potato in foil and roast until tender, about 30 minutes. Let cool. Peel and mash — you should have about 1 cup of mashed sweet potato.
- Reduce oven to 350°F.
- In a medium bowl, whisk eggs. Add sweet potato, almond butter and vanilla. Stir to combine.
- Add almond meal, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Stir until just combined.
- Coat an 8-by-8 baking pan with cooking spray. Dump batter into the pan; it will be thick, so use a spatula to spread it evenly. Sprinkle with cacao nibs, chocolate chips or nuts, if you like.
- Bake until set and starting to pull away from the edges, 20–25 minutes.
- Let cool at least 10 minutes before cutting into 16 pieces.

No added sugar and gluten-free, these brownies tackle a chocolate craving in a whole new, minimally sweet way. Substitute the nut butter of your choice, and know you can also sweeten them with 3 puréed, pitted dates (whirl in a food processor with the eggs) or 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of honey, maple syrup or other sweetener.
