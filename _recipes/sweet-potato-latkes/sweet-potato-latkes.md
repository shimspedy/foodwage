ingredients:
- Sweet Potato Latkes:

- 1|  teaspoon  oil
- 1|  medium  sweet potato  peeled and spiralized
- 1|  large  parsnip  peeled and spiralized
- 1|  large  egg beaten
- egg white  beaten
- 2|  scallions, green part only  chopped
- 0.5|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.5|  teaspoon  ground black pepper
- Plain Greek yogurt or sour cream  Optional Topping
- Applesauce  Optional Topping

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425°F. Grease a baking sheet with the oil.
- Bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Place the spiralized sweet potato and parsnip “noodles” in a large colander, and pour the boiling water over them. Drain the noodles well, and allow them to cool for about 10 minutes. Scooping out a handful at a time, put them into a clean, lint-free kitchen towel, and squeeze to remove as much liquid as possible. (Note: Paper towels will work as well.)
- Place the noodles into a large bowl with the eggs, scallions, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
- Mix well. Using a fork or your hands, scoop out 1/4 cup of the noodle mixture, and place onto the prepared baking sheet in the shape of a little nest. (You should get 12–14 latkes.) Press each latke down a bit with your hands.
- Bake for 20 minutes, flipping the latkes halfway through. The latkes will be golden brown, and the edges might get extra brown. Remove from the oven, and serve with applesauce and plain Greek yogurt or sour cream.
- Alternatively, you can cook the spiralized latkes in a skillet. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Working with 2–3 latkes at a time, scoop about 1/4 cup of the noodle mixture into the skillet. Cook for 3–4 minutes, until golden brown. Flip, press the latkes down with a spatula to flatten a bit and cook for another 3 minutes. Remove from the pan, and enjoy.

Eating Bird Food’s baked latkes with spiralized sweet potato and parsnip are a healthy twist on traditional fried potato latkes (or “potato pancakes”) and make one heckuva tasty snack. Enjoy these crisp bites while they’re hot out of the oven (or before they’re all gone)! If you don’t have a spiralizer, opt for a box grater instead.
