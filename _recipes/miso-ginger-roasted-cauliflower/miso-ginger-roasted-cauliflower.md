- 2|  tbsp  melted coconut oil or avocado oil

- Chop the cauliflower into small bite-sized florets and place them in a very large bowl.
- Whirl all the ingredients for the miso-ginger glaze in a food processor until it becomes as smooth as possible. It should have the consistency of a paste.
- Pour the glaze over the cauliflower, coating it as much as possible.
- Transfer the cauliflower onto the baking sheets, spreading it out into a single layer for even roasting. (You may need to do this in batches depending on the size of your oven and baking sheets.)
- Roast for 25–30 mins or until the cauliflower is charred on the edges.
- Serve hot, garnished with cilantro and drizzled with lime juice.
