notes:


ingredients:
- Cauliflower Crust:

- 1|  medium head cauliflower
- 1|  egg
- 0.5|  cup  Parmesan cheese  grated
- 1|  clove garlic  minced
- 0.5|  cup  almond flour
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  black pepper

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425°F.
- Trim off and discard any leaves from the cauliflower; cut it into florets. In a food processor, pulse the cauliflower until it resembles couscous. (Alternately, grate it against a large-hole grater.) Lay a clean kitchen towel on the counter and transfer the cauliflower to the center of the towel. Lift the towel by the corners, pull the sides up, and, working over a sink, twist until the cauliflower forms a ball and liquid seeps out of the towel. Keep twisting until liquid stops seeping from the cauliflower. Set aside.
- In a medium bowl, whisk the egg. Stir in the Parmesan, garlic, almond flour, salt and pepper. Add the cauliflower and stir to combine.
- Line a baking sheet or pizza pan with parchment paper (this keeps the crust from sticking without using a ton of oil). Transfer the cauliflower “dough” to the pan and use your hands to spread and press it into an even 1/4-inch-thick circle. You can use a rolling pin to even it out, if you like.
- Bake until set, golden on top and browning on the edges, about 25 minutes.
- Serve as a flatbread or add toppings and bake until toppings are as you like them.

We tried a bunch of methods and landed on this one for delivering a cauliflower pizza crust that has plenty of flavor (thanks, Parmesan cheese!), browns nicely and even holds together when you pick up a slice. Squeezing the liquid out of raw cauliflower is a key step — don’t skip it. One tip: keep the sauce to a minimum to avoid over-soaking the tender crust.
