notes:

ingredients:
- Mayo:

- 3.5|  tablespoons  mayonnaise
- 1  tablespoon  chipotle chile in adobo sauce  chopped

- Burgers:

- 15  ounce  reduced-sodium black beans  1 can, rinsed and drained
- red bell pepper  roughly chopped
- 0.5|  cup  scallions  roughly chopped
- 3|  tablespoons  fresh cilantro  roughly chopped
- 3|  garlic
- 0.5|  cup  quick-cooking oats
- 1|  large egg
- 1|  teaspoon  cayenne pepper hot sauce  such as Frank’s
- 1|  tablespoon  ground cumin
- 0.25|  teaspoon  kosher salt
- cooking spray or oil mister
- 4|  whole wheat potato rolls  approx. 90 calories each
- 1|  medium Hass Avocado  thinly sliced, Additional Toppings

directions:
- For the spicy chipotle mayo: In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise and chipotle. Set aside.
- For the black bean burgers: Dry the beans well after rinsing (any extra moisture will keep the burgers from holding together well). Put the beans in a medium bowl and mash them with a fork or potato masher until thick and pasty.
- In a food processor, combine the bell pepper, scallions, cilantro, and garlic and pulse until finely chopped. Add the oats, egg, hot sauce, cumin, and salt and pulse a few times, until mixed well. Fold the mixture into the mashed beans. Form the mixture into 4 patties (using slightly oiled or wet hands helps) and put them on a baking sheet lined with wax paper. (If the mixture is too wet, refrigerate it for 30 minutes or add another tablespoon of oats.)
- Freeze for at least 2 hours before cooking.
- To cook, heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lightly spray the skillet with oil and cook the frozen burgers until browned, about 7 minutes per side. (Alternatively, preheat a grill to medium, lightly spray a sheet of foil with oil, put the burgers on the foil, and grill until browned, 7 to 8 minutes per side.)
- To serve, place the burgers on the buns, and top with the spicy chipotle mayo and avocado slices.
