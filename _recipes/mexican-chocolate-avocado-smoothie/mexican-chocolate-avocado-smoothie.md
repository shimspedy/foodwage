This low-sugar avocado smoothie is rich, filling and chocolatey thanks to ripe avocado and unsweetened cocoa. Adding little cinnamon, vanilla and a pinch of cayenne pepper gives this unique shake a flavor reminiscent of Mexican hot chocolate. For more protein, substitute unsweetened pea milk or peanut milk for the almond or rice milk.
