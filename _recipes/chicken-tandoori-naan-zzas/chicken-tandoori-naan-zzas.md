Whole-wheat naan (Indian flatbread) makes a great base for miniature pizzas. Indian jarred Tikka Masala sauce (look for a low-sodium brand like Maia Kaimal) makes a delicious substitute for pizza sauce and rotisserie chicken breast adds protein in this super-simple recipe that’s ready in just 15 minutes.
