ingredients:
- Frittata:

- 1|  tsp  olive oil  3|
- 4|  cup  spinach  4|
- 2|  large eggs  7|
- 2|  tbsp  shredded Parmesan cheese  1|

directions:
- Coat a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan with cooking spray and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC).
- In a large skillet, drizzle the olive oil and place over medium-high heat. Add the onions and stir until sizzling. Add the cauliflower and stir for a minute, then cover the pan and lower the heat to medium-low. Cook for 10 minutes, until the cauliflower is tender when pierced with a paring knife. Scrape the cauliflower mixture into the pie pan, fluffing it to cool for 10 minutes.
- In the bowl of a food processor, place the spinach and process to chop. Scrape down the sides and add the chevre cheese and process to puree. Add the eggs, egg whites, parmesan and thyme and process until smooth.
- Bake for 45 minutes, until the frittata is puffed in the center and feels firm when pressed. Cool on a rack for at least 5 minutes before cutting in four portions. Serve warm. Store leftovers, tightly covered, for up to 4 days.

Cauliflower takes the place of potatoes in this easy frittata, making a lower-carb, high-protein, vegetable-rich meal. The longer you sauté the onions, the more flavor they impart, so go ahead and let them caramelize a bit while you prep everything else.
