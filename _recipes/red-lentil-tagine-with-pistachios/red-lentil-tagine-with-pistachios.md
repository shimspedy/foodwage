Red lentils are the smart cookâ€™s secret weapon, delivering all the savory nutrition of beans in 20 minutes of cooking time. Tender sweet potatoes melt into the soup, giving it an earthy, all-natural sweetness. Moroccan spices add an exotic flavor and fragrance that makes the dish seem much richer. Currants and pistachios add little explosions of chew and crunch, for extra excitement. Serve this as a vegetarian main dish or a hearty side.
