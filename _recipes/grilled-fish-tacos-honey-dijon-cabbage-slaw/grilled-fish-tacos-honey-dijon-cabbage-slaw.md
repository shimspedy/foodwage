ingredients:
- Fish:

- 12|  oz  Halibut or other white fish like Rockfish, Sea Bass or Tilapia  cut into 2 filets
- 3|  tablespoons  Lime Juice  divided
- 0.5|  teaspoon  Cumin
- 0.25|  teaspoon  Cayenne Pepper
- 1|  pinch  Sea Salt
- 0.5|  medium Avocado
- 6|  small Corn Tortillas  approx. 50 calories each; certified gluten-free if necessary

- Honey Dijon Cabbage Slaw:

- 1|  cup  Red Cabbage  thinly sliced
- 0.33333333333|  cup  Red Onion  thinly sliced
- 0.25|  cup  Cilantro  coarsely chopped
- 1|  lime juice  about 2 tablespoons
- 2|  wedges  lime  for serving
- to taste  Salsa
- to taste  Hot Sauce

directions:
- Place fish in a glass pan and squeeze the juice from one lime over the fish. In a small bowl, whisk together garlic powder, cumin, cayenne and sea salt. Sprinkle over fish and gently rub the seasoning in. Allow the fish to marinate for 10 minutes or so.
- Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine cabbage, onion, cilantro, juice from the lime, mustard, honey, salt and pepper. Toss to combine. Set aside.
- Heat grill to medium-high and lightly oil grill-grate. Arrange tortillas in a stack and wrap with aluminum foil. Grill fish until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place tortillas on cooler part of grill (we used the top rack) until warm, 5 to 8 minutes, turning halfway.
- For grilled avocado: Cut avocado in half and remove seed. Drizzle with fresh lime juice and brush lightly with olive oil. Gently place cut-side down and grill over hot coals for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt, to taste.
    
- Break fish into large pieces. Taste slaw and season to your liking by adding more mustard, honey, salt and pepper if needed. Divide fish among tortillas and top with slaw, grilled avocado slices and your favorite salsa and hot sauce. Serve each taco with a lime wedge for squeezing over the taco before digging in.
