ingredients:
- For the Falafel:
-  2|  cup  cooked chickpeas
-  0.5|  large onion  roughly chopped
-  2-3|  garlic cloves  peeled and roughly chopped
-  2|  tsp  cumin
-  0.5| lemon  juiced
-  2|  tbsp  olive oil
-  0.5|  tsp/each  salt and pepper
-  1|  tsp  baking soda
-  1|  cup  cooked quinoa
-  0.5|  cup  chopped parsley
-  1|  tbsp  sesame seeds optional
- For the Lemon Dill Yogurt Sauce:
-  0.5|  cup  plain yogurt
-  0.5|  lemon  juiced
-  1|  tsp  honey
-  2|  tsp  dried dill
-  2|  tsp  dried dill
-  0.25|  tsp  pepper
- For the Lettuce Wrap:
- 18|  butter lettuce or romaine leaves about 2 heads
- 3|  medium  tomatos  chopped
- 3|  small  avocados  sliced in half

directions:
-  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F, line a baking sheet with parchment. 
-  In a food processor, add the chickpeas, onion, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, salt, pepper, olive oil, baking soda, and sesame seeds. Pulse until you have a thick paste, without almost no chunks. 
-  In a large mixing bowl, add the chickpea mixture, quinoa and parsley. Stir together until evenly combined. 
-  Form the falafels with your hands by taking about 2 tablespoons of the mixture at a time. Gently roll it in the palm of your hand to form a ball, and place it on the baking sheet. Continue with the rest of the batter.  
-  Bake for 30 minutes in the oven, until lightly browned and slightly crispy on the outside. 
-  While the falafels bake, make your sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together all of the yogurt sauce ingredients and let it sit in the fridge until ready to use.  
-  Build your lettuce wraps by layering the falafels, veg components and sauce into a lettuce leaf.

Baked falafels are a crispy way to get your lean protein and fiber in! Courtesy of The Wheatless Kitchen, these delicious falafels are made by baking ground chickpeas for a healthy alternative to the traditional deep-fried version. Serve them up with tangy lemon-dill yogurt sauce and watch them disappear.
