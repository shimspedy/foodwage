notes:

ingredients:
- Grilled Zucchini Corn Salad:

- 3|  medium  zucchinis  halved lengthwise
- 2|  large  ears of corn  husk and silk removed
- 0.25|  cup  feta cheese, crumbled
- 2|  tablespoon  lemon juice
- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 0.25|  cup  packed basil leaves
- Black Pepper  to taste

directions:
- Heat the grill on medium (clean the grates as necessary to avoid sticking). While grill is heating, lightly grease zucchini and corn with oil.
- Place zucchini and corn over direct flames on the grill for 10 minutes, turning every few minutes for grill marks.
- After 10 minutes, move the corn away from direct heat but still leave it inside the grill. Flip zucchini and cook for another 5 minutes until easy to pierce with a fork, but not soft. Remove the vegetables from the grill and allow them to cool slightly.
- Slice zucchini width-wise into 1/2â€³ chunks and cut corn off the cob. Thinly slice the basil.
- Toss vegetables with feta cheese crumbles, lemon juice, olive oil, and sliced basil. Serve as a side dish at room temperature or cold.

This smoky vegetable salad by Uproot Kitchen makes a great side for your grilling party. Juicy corn kernels and tender zucchini are dressed in a tangy lemon-basil vinaigrette. To make this vegan-friendly just leave out the feta cheese.
