ingredients:
- Cider-Braised Chicken and Mushrooms:

- 4|  bone-in chicken thighs  skin removed
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  pepper
- 1|  tablespoon olive oil  divided
- 2|  large shallots  thinly sliced (1/2 cup)
- 4|  cup  cremini mushrooms  quartered (about 4 cups)
- 2|  medium garlic cloves  finely chopped
- 2|  teaspoon  fresh thyme  chopped and divided
- 0.75|  cup hard apple cider
- 0.5|  cup  low-sodium chicken broth
- 1|  tablespoon  grainy mustard

directions:
- Season the chicken with the salt and pepper. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken to the pan and cook until lightly browned, 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate.
- Add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of oil to the skillet. Add the mushrooms and shallots and sauté, stirring frequently, until mushrooms begin to brown, 4 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, 45 seconds.
- Reduce heat to medium low. Add the cider, broth and mustard and bring to a simmer, scraping up browned bits on bottom of pan. Add the chicken and any accumulated juices from the plate, cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer uncovered until the sauce has reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Serve.
