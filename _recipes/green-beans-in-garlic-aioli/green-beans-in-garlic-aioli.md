notes:

ingredients:
- For the garlic aioli sauce:

- 1|  large  pasteurized egg  oom temperature ( omit if you don’t have pasteurized eggs on-hand)
- 2|  tsp  fresh squeezed lemon juice
- 0.75|  cup  neutral-flavored oil such as light olive oil or grapeseed
- 2|  small  cloves garlic  finely minced
- Pinch of sea salt  to taste

- For the green beans:

- green beans  washed and trimmed
- 1|  tsp  olive oil
directions:
- For the garlic aioli - The aioli is best prepared a few hours in advance and left to sit in the fridge, covered, so the flavors can develop.
- For the garlic aioli - Separate the room temperature egg and place the egg yolk in a small bowl with high sides. Discard of the egg white for another purpose. Whisk in the fresh squeezed lemon juice.
- For the garlic aioli - Slowly, a few drops at a time, whisk in the oil. Once the aioli starts to thicken you can begin the pour the oil in a little faster. If the oil starts to build up at all stop pouring and whisk briskly to incorporate it. Continue until all the oil has been incorporated and the aioli is nice and thick.
- For the garlic aioli - Add the finely minced garlic and stir together well. Season to taste with sea salt.
- For the green beans - Set the oven to broil at 420 F degrees and place the oven rack on the top shelf. If you cannot control the temperature of broil in your oven then move the oven rack to the second from the top position and keep a closer eye on the beans. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
- For the green beans - Place the green beans on the prepared baking tray and drizzle them with the olive oil. Broil in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until they just start to brown. There’s no need to turn them as they’re best (I think!) when they brown only on one side.
- For the green beans - Serve the beans with the garlic aioli on the side or drizzled over top.
