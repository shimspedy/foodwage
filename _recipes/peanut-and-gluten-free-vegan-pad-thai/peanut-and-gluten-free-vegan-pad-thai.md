This pad thai from The Honour System plays it safe for those with dietary restrictions without sacrificing the flavor and texture of the traditional dish. Find protein in the form of ground almonds, with an option to add egg or tofu for non-vegans. Homemade faux soy sauce — a low-sodium and soy-free substitute — makes this dish stand out at only 67 milligrams of sodium per serving.
