- 2|  teaspoon  potato starch

directions:
- Poach chicken breasts => Fill a large saucepan about two-thirds full with water and bring to a boil. Add chicken and as soon as the water starts to bubble again, cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Water should cover chicken breasts by about 1 inch. Cook at a low simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the thickest part and registers 165°F on an instant-read thermometer, 22–25 minutes. When cool enough to handle, pull chicken off bones and tear into bite-size pieces. Set aside. (Tip => Yo4
- Preheat oven to 350°F. In a large skillet on medium-high, heat oil. Add onion, bell pepper, 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cook for 12–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly browned. Add cumin, chili powder, and oregano and stir to combine. Add garlic and jalapeño, and cook until garlic softens, stirring frequently about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, and bring to a simmer. Stir in corn, and cook until heated through about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low.
- in a small bowl, stir together about 2 tablespoons milk and potato starch until combined; stir in remaining milk. Add to skillet and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly until slightly thickened about 1 minute. Stir in chicken and cook until heated through about 1 minute. Season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Remove from heat.
- Mist a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange half of the tortillas over the bottom of the dish, overlapping slightly. Top with half of the chicken mixture, then sprinkles with half of the cheese. Add a second layer of tortillas, chicken, and cheese. Cover with foil and bake until liquid is bubbling and cheese is melted, 35–45 minutes. Rest for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with green onions.
