Grilled cheese is a comfort-food classic for good reason, but itâ€™s also a calorie bomb. This 5-ingredient grilled cheese sandwich recipe from Clean Eating Magazine clocks in at less than 250 calories by using tangy blue cheese in place of high-calorie cheddar. Arugula and pear slices bring the fiber content to 6 grams, which is unheard of in most traditional grilled cheese sandwiches.
