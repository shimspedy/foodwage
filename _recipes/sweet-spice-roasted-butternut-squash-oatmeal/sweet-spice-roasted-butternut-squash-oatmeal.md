ingredients:
- Sweet Spice-Roasted Butternut Squash Oatmeal:

- 1.5|  cup  butternut squash  peeled and cubed (1/2-inch)
- 1|  teaspoon  safflower oil
- 1|  teaspoon  ground cinnamon
- 0.25|  teaspoon  ground nutmeg
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt  divided
- 1.25|  cup  old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1|  cup  low-fat milk or unsweetened non-dairy milk
- 2|  tablespoon  maple syrup
- 2|  tablespoon  orange zest  finely grated
- 0.5|  cup  walnuts  toasted and chopped

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F. On a parchment-lined baking sheet, toss the squash, oil, cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Arrange in an even layer. Roast until squash is tender when pierced with a fork, 20 minutes. The roasted squash can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat in microwave before serving.
- In a medium saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups water, milk and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the oats and reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered, stirring frequently, until the oats are tender, 12 minutes. Stir in the maple syrup and orange zest. Divide among 4 bowls. Top with warm squash and walnuts.

This oatmeal bowl gets subtle sweetness from maple syrup and orange zest and an unusual ingredient — butternut squash. Cubed butternut squash, roasted with cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom, adds a warm sweetness, think of it as the real “pumpkin spice.”
