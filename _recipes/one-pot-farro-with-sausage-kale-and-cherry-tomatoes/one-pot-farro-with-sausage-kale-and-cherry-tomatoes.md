Quick-cooking farro and tomatoes make for an insanely easy, one-pot wonder that will revolutionize your weeknight cooking. This recipe is a spin on a one-pot pasta, but in place of spaghetti we use farro, a nutty, fiber-rich grain. Sausage, kale, tomatoes, garlic and onion are all cooked in one vessel with some water and a little olive oil and gently simmered until the grain absorbs the liquid and the tomatoes break down to make a bright sauce. The result is a filling, risotto-like dish that also reheats beautifully for lunch the next day. This recipe calls for quick-cooking farro, but semi-pearled also works. If necessary, cook your farro for an additional 5–10 minutes until most of the liquid is absorbed.
