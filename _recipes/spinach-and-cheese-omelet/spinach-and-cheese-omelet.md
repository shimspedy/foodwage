notes:
- The heat of the pan is critical to making perfect omelets. The omelet needs to set without the outer surface overbrowning. You can remove the pan from the stove briefly if the eggs are cooking too quickly and lower the stove temperature.

ingredients:
- Omelet:

- 2| large eggs
- Sprinkle  salt
- Sprinkle  freshly ground pepper
- 0.5| teaspoon unsalted butter
- 1| tablespoon diced ripe tomatoes
- 2| tablespoons  thawed frozen spinach  patted dry, or 0.33| cup fresh baby spinach (approx. 10g)
- 1| tablespoon grated reduced-fat cheddar cheese

directions:
- Whisk the eggs, salt, and pepper in a bowl until very light and frothy. The more you whip the eggs, the lighter the omelet will be; set aside.
- Melt the butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the tomatoes and spinach and cook for 1 minute, stirring, just until hot.
- Transfer to a small plate or bowl and set aside. (Do not rinse the skillet.)
- Return the skillet to medium-low heat, add the eggs, and cook for about 20 seconds. Then, while tilting the skillet, use a spatula to push the cooked egg toward the center of the pan, allowing the raw eggs to hit the skillet.
- Distribute the cheese on top, followed by the reserved tomato-spinach mixture. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the eggs are set.Fold the omelet in half, tuck in the sides if necessary, and cook for 10 to 30 seconds longer, until the omelet is the way you like it. Serve immediately.
