notes:

ingredients:
- Soup
- 1| tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
- 3|  small leek bulbs  outer layers removed, chopped
- 1| medium onion  chopped
- 1| teaspoon salt  divided
- 0.5| teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 28|  ounce  low-sodium diced tomatoes  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 15|  ounce  cannellini beans  rinsed and drained (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 10| ounces  fresh baby spinach
- 1| cup  low-sodium vegetable broth  certified gluten-free if necessary
directions:
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
- In a Dutch oven or large oven-safe pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the leek, onion, 0.5 teaspoon of the salt and the red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes.
- Add the tomatoes (plus juices), beans, spinach and broth. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and transfer to the oven. Cook until the vegetables are tender and the spinach has wilted, 25 to 30 minutes.
- I took mine out of the oven after 25 minutes and gave it a good stir, and then placed it back in the oven for 5 more minutes.
- Stir in the other 0.5 teaspoon of salt and enjoy!
