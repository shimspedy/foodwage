notes:


ingredients:
- Eggplant Parmesan:

- 1|  large eggplants
- Salt and pepper  to taste
- 2|  large  eggs
- 0.75|  cup  shredded Parmesan
- 0.66666666666|  cup  almond flour  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 1|  cup  shredded mozzarella  divided
- 1|  jar marinara sauce  divided (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- Dried parsley  optional

directions:
- Slice the eggplant into 1/3-inch slices. Transfer to a colander, sprinkle with salt and toss until all slices are salted. Set aside for 5–10 minutes.
- Pat eggplant slices dry with a paper towel.
- In a small bowl, break the eggs and stir well with a fork. In a second small bowl, combine the Parmesan cheese and almond flour.
- Grease two baking sheets with cooking spray. Dip each eggplant slice in the eggs, then drop into the almond-Parmesan mixture and turn to coat. Transfer to the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining eggplant.
- Bake for 15 minutes on one side, and flip with a spatula. Bake another 15 minutes, until lightly browned.
- Spread about 1/3 cup marinara sauce in the bottom of a 9-by-11-inch baking dish. Layer on half the eggplant slices, and top with 3/4 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/2 of the sauce. Add a second layer of eggplant slices, and top with the rest of the sauce and the last of the mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle with dried parsley, if using.
- Bake for 20–25 minutes or until sauce is bubbly and mozzarella cheese has melted.
