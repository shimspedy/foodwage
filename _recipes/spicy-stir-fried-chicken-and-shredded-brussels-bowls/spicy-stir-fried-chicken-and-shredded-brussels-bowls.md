ingredients:
- Spicy Stir-Fried Chicken and Shredded Brussels Bowls:

- 1|  tsp  grapeseed or canola oil
- 93%| fat-free ground chicken
- 3|  tbsp  reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 0.25|  tsp  crushed red pepper
- 0.5|  small onion  chopped
- 2|  garlic cloves  minced
- 0.5|  tsp  fresh ginger  grated
- 3|  cup  shredded Brussels sprouts
- 0.5|  cup  shredded carrots
- 0.25|  cup  sliced red bell pepper
- 0.75|  cup  sliced shiitake mushrooms
- 0.5|  tsp  Shaoxing (Chinese rice wine)  mirin or dry sherry
- 1|  tsp  toasted sesame oil
- 1|  medium  scallion  sliced, for garnish

directions:
- In a large nonstick skillet or wok, heat 0.5 teaspoon of the grapeseed oil over high heat. When the pan is hot and almost smoking, add the chicken, 0.5 tablespoon of the soy sauce and the crushed red pepper. Brown the chicken, using a wooden spoon to break it into small pieces as it cooks, 3–4 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until softened, 2–3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.
- To the pan, add the remaining 0.5 teaspoon grapeseed oil, the Brussels sprouts and carrots. Cook, stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and mushrooms. Pour in the remaining 2.5 tablespoons soy sauce, rice wine and sesame oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Return the chicken to the skillet, stir and reheat for about 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat, garnish with the scallion, and divide between two bowls.

Brussels sprouts in a stir-fry? Why not! Although you’ll probably never see this dish on a Chinese takeout menu, I love making stir-fries with uncommon ingredients. Shred the  sprouts thinly with a sharp knife or buy them pre-shredded, and make sure your pan is really hot so they brown a little on the edges. This low-carb dish is so loaded with veggies you won’t even miss the rice.
