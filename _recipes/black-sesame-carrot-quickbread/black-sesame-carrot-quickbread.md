ingredients:
- Black Sesame & Carrot Quickbread:

- 1.5|  cup  organic unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1.5|  teaspoon  baking powder
- 0.25|  teaspoon finely ground sea salt
- 0.75|  cup  organic granulated sugar
- granulated  cup  packed brown sugar
- 0.5|  cup  canola oil
- 0.33333333333|  cup  unsweetened applesauce
- 0.25|  cup  unsweetened almond milk, or other milk of choice
- 2|  teaspoon  finely ground ginger
- 0.5|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- 3|  medium carrots  peeled and coarsely grated
- 3|  tablespoon  black sesame seeds

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F.
- Coat an 8-by-4 loaf pan with coconut cooking spray and line with parchment paper. Set aside.
- In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg.
- In a separate, large bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, oils, applesauce, almond milk, ginger and vanilla. Gradually whisk in dry ingredients, then fold in carrots (be careful not to overmix). Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top and sprinkle with black sesame seeds.
- Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 75–85 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let the bread cool completely in the pan before turning out. Once completely cool, lift out the parchment paper (like a little sling) then slice and eat!
- This quick bread can be made three days ahead. Store, tightly wrapped, at room temperature. Makes 1 loaf.

Sure, you’re no stranger to carrot cake. But carrot cake doesn’t have to mean big slathers of cream cheese frosting. What about a carrot cake that packs a nutritious punch that’s more suitable with coffee for breakfast rather than with birthday candles? We like this Black Sesame & Carrot Quickbread because it’s less sweet and has “snack” written all over it.
