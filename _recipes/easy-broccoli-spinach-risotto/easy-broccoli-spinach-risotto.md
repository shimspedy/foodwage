Enjoy a fancy risotto dinner with less fuss using this recipe tweak—bake your risotto! Traditional risotto requires stirring small batches of hot broth into the rice every few minutes, but our baked method creates a similar consistency without extra tending. This vegetarian version comes loaded with broccoli and spinach, but feel free to add your favorite veggies instead.
