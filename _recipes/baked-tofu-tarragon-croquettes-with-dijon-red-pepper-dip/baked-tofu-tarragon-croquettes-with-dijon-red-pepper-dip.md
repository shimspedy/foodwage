notes:

- 
ingredients:
- Croquettes:

- 12| oz firm nigari tofu drained and pressed
- 0.5| cup rolled oats chopped
- 1| cup carrot shredded
- 1| tsp dried tarragon
- 2| egg whites large
- 1| tbsp tamari soy sauce

- dip:

- 1| tbsp olive oil
- 1| large red bell pepper chopped
- 5.3| oz 0% Greek yogurt 1 container
- 1| tbsp honey
- 1| tsp red wine vinegar
- 1| tsp paprika

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and reserve. Wrap the tofu in a thick kitchen towel and press by placing a heavy pot on top for a few minutes.
- Crumble the tofu into a large bowl. Pour the oats on a cutting board and chop into small pieces, then scrape into the bowl with the tofu and stir. Add the carrots, tarragon, egg whites, tamari and mix, using your hands to crush the tofu so it forms a mixture that holds together.
- Use a 0.25-cup (60ml) measure to scoop the tofu mixture, packing it firmly. Tap the cup to drop each portion on to the parchment-lined pan, and flatten each to 0.75-inch (1.9cm) thick with your palm. Bake for 20 minutes, until the tofu croquettes are browned and firm when pressed.
- While the tofu bakes, warm the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the peppers and stir, reducing the heat to medium when they start to sizzle. Cook, stirring until the peppers are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer the peppers and oil to a food processor or blender and process to puree. When smooth, add the yogurt, honey, vinegar and paprika and process until creamy. Transfer to a small bowl.
