notes:


ingredients:
- Lemon Coconut Protein No-bake Bites:

- 8|  Medjool dates  pitted
- 0.5|  cup  unsweetened applesauce
- Zest and juice of 1 large lemon
- 0.5|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- 0.5|  cup  coconut flour
- 1|  scoop  vanilla protein powder  I used Vega Vanilla Protein + Greens
- Pinch of salt
- 0.25|  cup  almond milk  plus more, if needed
- Unsweetened shredded coconut, for rolling

directions:
- Place dates, applesauce, lemon juice, lemon zest and vanilla in a large food processor. Process until dates look nearly pureed and mixture is very-well combined.
- Add coconut flour, protein powder and salt. Process until mixture forms a smooth ball of “dough.” (If mixture looks too dry, add almond milk. If it looks too wet, add coconut flour.)
- Roll into 12 balls. Place about 1/2 cup shredded coconut in a small bowl and roll balls in coconut, if desired. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
