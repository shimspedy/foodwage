meal: dinner
chef: foodwage
time: under 15 mins

notes:
 - Cook time may be longer for larger chicken thighs or breasts, so poke the thigh with a fork or skewer and see if the juices run clear to indicate theyâ€™ve been cooked thoroughly.

ingredients:
-   0.5| cup  ketchup  certified gluten-free if necessary
-   1.5| tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
-   1.5| teaspoons  molasses
-   0.5| cup  unsweetened dried apricots

-   0.5| teaspoon  garlic powder
-   0.25| teaspoon  sea salt
-   12|  chicken thighs  about 3.5 ounces or 98g per thigh

directions:
-   Place apricots in a bowl and cover with water. Let them soak for at least 1 hour.  
-   Drain apricots and place in a blender or food processor, and blend until a smooth paste is formed.
-   In a medium-sized pot, add apricot paste with all the ingredients except the chicken thighs. Bring ingredients to a boil and then lower to a simmer; cook for 20 minutes.  
-   Let cool slightly before marinating chicken for at least 1 hour in fridge, but ideally overnight.
