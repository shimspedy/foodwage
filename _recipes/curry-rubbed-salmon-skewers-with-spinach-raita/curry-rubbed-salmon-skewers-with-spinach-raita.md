This recipe is great if you are on a heart-healthy diet. The American Heart Association recommends eating 7 ounces of oily fish like salmon per week to help promote heart health, and this recipe gives you 5 ounces per serving.

Avoid your salmon sticking to the grill by arranging the peppers between the cubes of salmon, so the peppers rest on the hot grate, protecting the salmon while it cooks. The cooling raita is a delicious sauce for dipping.
