Summer’s not over yet, so fire up that grill while you still can and make these Cilantro Burgers with spicy Sriracha Mayo. Chopped cilantro flavors the beef, while whole sprigs take the place of lettuce. Sriracha has rightfully become an all-purpose condiment—its sweet chile heat and its vinegar punch go well beyond burgers, perking up brothy soups, meat marinades, and dipping sauces. Enjoy Cooking Light’s low-cal Cilantro Burgers with Sriracha Mayo with a fresh fruit salad for a complete meal.
