Sweet potatoes are a great source of healthy carbohydrates and low on the glycemic index, which means they won’t cause your blood sugar to spike. They’re also rich in vitamins A, B and C and their high fiber content helps you stay full longer. Here, they’re combined with antioxidant-rich dark chocolate for a sweet-savory breakfast.
