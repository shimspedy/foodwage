ingredients:
- Pork Chops With Roasted Vegetables:

- 4|  boneless center-cut loin pork chops
- 0.5|  teaspoon  kosher salt  divided
- 0.75|  teaspoon  black pepper  divided
- 0.25|  cup  olive oil  divided
- 6|  small  red potatoes  halved
- 3|  tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
- 1|  teaspoon  tomato paste
- 1|  tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
- 1|  medium  red onion  peeled and cut into 8 wedges

- 0.25|  cup  Gorgonzola cheese  crumbled (about 1 ounce)

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425°F (218ºC).

Add pork to pan; cook 3 minutes on each side or until browned. Place pork on a plate (pork will not be cooked through). Reduce heat to medium-high.

Combine 2 tablespoons balsamic mixture, thyme, onion and mushrooms in a bowl, tossing to coat. Add mushroom mixture to pan. Bake at 425°F for 25 minutes, stirring after 10 minutes. Arrange pork chops over vegetables; bake 10 minutes, or until a thermometer registers 145°F. Remove pork from pan. Sprinkle vegetable mixture with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Place 1 cup vegetable mixture on each of 4 plates. Top each serving with 1 pork chop, 2 teaspoons remaining balsamic vinegar mixture, 1 1/2 teaspoons parsley and 1 tablespoon Gorgonzola cheese.

Cooking Light’s pork chops with roasted vegetables are made with a quick balsamic vinaigrette that’s both a marinade for the vegetables and a sauce for the pork. What’s more, this time-saving recipe uses only one roasting pan from stove to oven so the pork, potatoes and onions finish at the same time. Tonight’s dinner will be served in minimal time with minimal cleanup.
