servings: 8

ingredients:
- 1|  spaghetti squash
- 2|  teaspoon  olive oil
- 0.25|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.25|  tablespoon  ground black pepper  divided
- extra-lean ground beef
- 1.5|  teaspoon  crushed red pepper
- 3|  cloves garlic  minced
- white mushrooms  diced
- 4|  cup  baby spinach  thinly sliced
- 0.25|  cup  unsalted pine nuts  toasted
- 1|  jar pasta sauce
- 1|  container whole-milk ricotta cheese
- 0.33333333333|  cup  Parmesan cheese  shredded

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F.
- Halve the squash, and scrape out and discard the seeds. Brush the inside of the squash with the oil, and sprinkle with salt and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.
- Place the squash on a baking sheet, cut sides down. Roast for 35 minutes, until soft. Remove from the oven, and scrape out the flesh with a fork. (You should have about 4 cups squash.)
- Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
- Meanwhile, in a large pot on medium-high, sauté the beef, crushed red pepper and remaining 1/8 teaspoon black pepper for 8 minutes, breaking beef apart as it cooks and juices are released. Add the garlic, and sauté for 2–3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, and sauté for 5–7 minutes. Add the spinach, and cook until it starts to wilt, about 1 minute. Add the pine nuts, pasta sauce, ricotta and reserved spaghetti squash; stir until well-mixed.
- Transfer mixture to an 11-by-7-inch baking dish; top with Parmesan. Cover casserole loosely with foil. Bake for 20 minutes, removing the foil after 15 minutes. 
- Remove from oven, and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
