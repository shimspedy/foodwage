If you have leftover rotisserie chicken or cooked chicken breast, make this high-protein chicken salad as an easy lunch option. Lean shredded chicken is combined with creamy yogurt, crispy apples and sweet grapes for a tasty, tangy combo. Serve between 100% whole grain bread and you have a satisfying, packable lunch. If youâ€™d rather go low-carb, you can sub in a side salad instead of the bread.
