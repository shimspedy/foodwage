ingredients:
- Carrot-White Bean Hummus in Cucumber Boats:

- 1|  cup  sliced carrot
- 4|  cloves garlic  peeled
- canned navy beans  drained and rinsed
- 0.5|  cup  tahini
- 0.25|  cup  fresh lemon juice  plus 1 tablespoon,
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 0.5|  tsp  paprika
- 5|  medium  cucumbers
- 2|  large  green onions  chopped

directions:
- Set up a steamer and steam the carrots and whole garlic cloves over simmering water for 5 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Add the navy beans and process, scraping down the sides, as needed, until completely smooth. Add the tahini, and process until smooth and well-mixed. Drizzle the lemon juice through the feed tube while the machine is running, then add the salt and paprika and mix. Scrape into a medium bowl. It will be thick; if desired, stir in a little water.
- To serve, peel the cucumbers, then halve lengthwise. Using a small spoon, scrape out the seeds and pulp. Spoon 3 rounded tablespoons of hummus into the cavity of each cucumber, spreading evenly with the spoon. Place on a plate, and sprinkle with green onions. Serve immediately.

Hummus is one of the smarter options for snacks and lunches, because it’s high in protein and low in calories. This riff on the classic adds more vegetables to lighten it up and makes it even healthier. Adding carrots gives it an orange tint and a little natural sweetness — and serving it in cucumber boats cuts out the carbs in the standard pita bread.
