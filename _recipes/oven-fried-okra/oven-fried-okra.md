Ready for a crispy fix? You had us at oven-fried okra, aka baked. This recipe courtesy of Love & Zest turns a traditionally deep-fried treat into a healthy side. Thick-cut okra is baked in a crispy coating of egg and whole wheat breadcrumbs for added protein and fiber. Fun fact: The slimy “goo” inside okra pods is called mucilage and is high in soluble fiber. This soluble fiber is like the kind found in Metamucil.
