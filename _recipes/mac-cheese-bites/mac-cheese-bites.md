Let’s face it — mac and cheese is one of the ultimate comfort foods. Unfortunately, a one-cup serving of cheesy goodness averages 300–500 calories (or more), not to mention the high fat and sodium. Keep your taste buds satisfied without breaking your calorie bank with Cooking Light’s perfectly portioned mac and cheese bites.
