meal: breakfast
chef: foodwage
time: under 10 mins
servings: 4

notes:
- You can make the crepes ahead of time, stack and freeze them. Thaw if frozen, then reheat the foil-wrapped stack on a baking sheet at 350°F until the crepes are warm and pliable, 5 to 8 minutes, or in a skillet on the stovetop. Assemble as directed.

ingredients:
- crepes:
- 1|  cup  whole grain pastry flour
- 0.25| teaspoon  salt
- 1| large egg
- 1| cup unsweetened soy milk
- tablespoons  3 unsweetened soy milk
- 1.5| teaspoons  vanilla extract
- 2| teaspoons  butter
- 2| tablespoons  water

- filling:
- 0.5| cup  plain yogurt
- 1|  medium banana
- 2|  kiwi fruit  peeled, cut in half lengthwise, and sliced
- 2| teaspoons  lime juice
- 0.5| teaspoon  ground cinnamon
directions:
- In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. In a small bowl, beat the egg, then stir in the milk and vanilla. Pour into the flour and mix well.  
- Melt 0.5 teaspoon of the butter in an 8″ nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour 3 tablespoons of batter into the skillet and tilt the skillet to coat the bottom in a thin layer (if the batter seems too thick add 1 to 2 tablespoons water). Cook the first side until nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Using a spatula, turn the crepe and cook the second side for 1 to 2 minutes (the second side will look spotty). Slide the crepe onto a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.  
- Continue making crepes in the same fashion, rebuttering the pan after every second crepe, until all the butter and batter are used.
- Assemble crepe and filling: Place a crepe on a serving plate, attractive side down, and spread with 1 tablespoon of yogurt. Arrange the 2 banana slices and a quarter of a kiwifruit in strips one-third of the way from one edge. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the lime juice and a pinch of the cinnamon, and roll up. Continue assembling the remaining crepes.
