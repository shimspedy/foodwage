Simple but delicious, this three-bean salad from The Honour System is especially great as a healthy side at a barbecue or potluck. Good for carnivores and vegetarians, the beans offer a solid dose of fiber and protein per one-cup serving. Any three-bean combo will do, and if time allows, using dried beans is a good way to watch your sodium.
