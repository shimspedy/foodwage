Making your own granola is much better for you than boxed versions, which can be loaded with fat and sugar. Lightly sweetened with apple juice concentrate and maple syrup and packed with 12 grams of protein per serving, it’s delicious sprinkled over yogurt or fresh fruit. Freeze-dried mangos, not to be confused with dense, dried mango, are light and easily crushed. They add a sunny tropical flavor to this recipe. Look for freeze-dried fruit in bags where trail mix and energy bars are sold.
