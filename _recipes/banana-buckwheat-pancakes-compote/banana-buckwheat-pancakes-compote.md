- Use a wooden spoon to stir until the sugar coats the berries. Gently break up the berries with the spoon until they start to break down and turn into a thick sauce. If it is not as thick as you would like, you can add about a teaspoon of arrowroot or tapioca starch to the sauce. Stir to thicken.
- Top pancakes with compote sauce and enjoy!

Feast on these amazing banana buckwheat pancakes from The Wheatless Kitchen! Each nutty pancake has chunks of sweet banana and is topped with an irresistible blackberry compote. Buckwheat flour is a great gluten-free option plus it makes for dense pancakes so if you prefer lighter pancakes mix buckwheat flour with another flour of your choice.
