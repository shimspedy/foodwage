meal: dinner
chef: foodwage
time: under 1 hour 20 mins
servings: 8

notes:
- Andouille sausage and cajun seasoning are typically high in sodium. If you’re watching your salt intake but still want to partake, you can modify the recipe by swapping the andouille for a lower sodium sausage (or use half the amount) and choose a salt-free cajun seasoning instead.

ingredients:
- Jambalaya:

- 2| tablespoons  olive oil
- 1| medium yellow onion  chopped
- 1| medium green bell pepper  chopped
- 3| stalks  celery  chopped
- 1| cup brown rice  uncooked (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 1.5| pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts  chopped
- 12| ounces andouille sausage  sliced
- 1.5| cups low-sodium chicken broth  (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 0.5| cup dry white wine
- 14|  ounce  diced tomatoes  1 can
- 2| teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- 1| teaspoon dried thyme
- 0.5| pound shrimp  peeled and deveined
- 0.25| fresh parsley  chopped
- to taste  Kosher salt

directions:
- In a large pot or French oven, add the olive oil and heat to medium. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, celery and brown rice.
- Sauté, stirring frequently until vegetables have softened but are still al dente, about 10 minutes.
- Add the chopped chicken and andouille sausage and continue sautéing until chicken is slightly browned, but not cooked through, about 3 minutes.
- Add the chicken broth, white wine, diced tomatoes, Cajun seasoning, and dried thyme and stir everything together. Bring pot to a full boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 40 to 50 minutes until rice is soft.
- Add the peeled raw shrimp and fresh parsley and cook until shrimp is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
- Allow the jambalaya to sit about 10 to 15 minutes before serving, allowing it will thicken up. Add salt as desired.
