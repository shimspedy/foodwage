You may have tried stuffed tomatoes or stuffed bell peppers, but wait until you get a load of Maebells’ chili-cheese stuffed zucchini boats. Fresh zucchini — hollowed out and filled with a savory chili loaded with lean ground beef, spicy tomatoes and beans — makes a complete low-carb, protein-packed meal. For those who like it crunchy, top your boats with crushed tortilla chips.
