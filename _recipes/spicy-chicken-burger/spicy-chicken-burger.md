    Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, swirling to coat bottom. Add burgers and cook 4–5 minutes on each side or until completely cooked. Serve between buns with lettuce and tomato.

Say bye to bland burgers. These healthy, lean chicken patties are spiced up with smoky, chipotle peppers. And nothing pairs better with a burger than a side of fries. Crispy, chili-roasted sweet potato fries add a delicious zing to this flavor-filled meal.
