- Slow Cooker Turmeric Lentil Stew:

- 1|  cup  red lentils

- 2|  cup  chopped cauliflower
- 1|  large  onion  chopped

directions:
- In a slow cooker, combine red lentils, carrots, cauliflower, onion, vegetable stock, curry powder, and salt. Cover tightly and turn the cooker to high. Cook for 5 hours on high or, if preferred, 8 hours on low.
- When the time is up, remove the lid and stir. The lentils should be falling apart. Stir in the kale, cover, and let stand for about five minutes to soften the kale.
- Serve hot, or cool completely and portion into containers to refrigerate, tightly covered, for up to 4 days.

Your slow cooker is an ally in the kitchen, especially when you crave a comforting, satisfying soup. In this easy stew, red lentils are fall-apart tender, and the vegetables are soft as butter. A little curry spice keeps it interesting. Plus, itâ€™s loaded with fiber and high in quality plant-based protein.
