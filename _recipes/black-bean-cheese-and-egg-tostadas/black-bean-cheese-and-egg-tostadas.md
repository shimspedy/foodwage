Dress up scrambled eggs with a handful of black beans and a touch of cilantro, and then add some crunch by serving them on a crispy corn tortilla. These are ideal for a quick breakfast during the week or a more leisurely weekend brunch with family. Try also pairing one with a green salad, fruit or cup of tortilla soup for lunch.
