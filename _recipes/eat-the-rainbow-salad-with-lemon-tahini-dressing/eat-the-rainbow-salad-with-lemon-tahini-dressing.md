The veggies in this composed salad provide a rainbow of antioxidants. They are arranged atop nutty black rice (sometimes called “forbidden rice”), which contains as many antioxidants as blueberries and is fiber-rich, so you’ll be satiated longer. It’s worth noting that all the sugar comes naturally from the berries, carrots and tomatoes.
