ingredients:
- Baked Egg Cups with Garlic Toast:

- 2|  tablespoon  unsalted butter
- 1|  cup  sliced button mushrooms
- 0.5|  cup  trimmed and chopped asparagus
- 2|  tablespoon  half and half
- 4|  large  eggs  50 grams each
- 2|  tablespoon  grated Romano cheese
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- Freshly ground pepper  to taste
- 1|  clove garlic  peeled and sliced in half lengthwise
- 4|  slices whole-grain bread  about 1 ounce each

directions:
- Arrange a rack in center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (177°C). Fill a 9-inch square baking pan halfway with very hot water. Butter 4 (6-ounce) ramekins with 1 teaspoon butter each. Set aside.
- In a large skillet on medium-high, heat the remaining 2 teaspoons butter until foamy. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Divide mushrooms evenly among ramekins. Top with asparagus and half and half, dividing evenly. Crack 1 egg into each ramekin and top with cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
- Set ramekins into prepared pan and carefully transfer to oven. Bake until whites are set and yolks are still slightly runny, 15 to 18 minutes. Meanwhile, rub the cut side of garlic over 1 side of each bread slice, and toast until golden. Cut into triangles and serve with egg cups

Creamy, cheesy egg cups from our friends at Clean Eating can be made up to a day in advance. Prepare ingredients in ramekins (without baking), and keep in the fridge. About 15–20 minutes before you’re ready to serve, simply place them in a water bath and pop them in the oven.
