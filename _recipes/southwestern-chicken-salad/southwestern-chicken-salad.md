notes:

ingredients:
- Southwestern Chicken Salad:

- 2|  tsp  olive oil
- 0.75|  tsp  salt  divided
- 0.75|  tsp  black pepper  divided
- boneless, skinless chicken breast
- 0.25|  cup  plain Greek yogurt
- 2|  tbsp  mayonnaise
- 0.25|  cup  salsa
- 3|  tbsp  lime juice  about 1 1/2 limes, squeezed
- 2|  tsp  chili powder
- 1|  can  black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1|  cup  corn kernels
directions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).
- Line a baking dish with parchment paper. Lightly rub the parchment paper with oil to prevent chicken from sticking.
- Pat the chicken breast dry, rub with oil, and sprinkle with 1/0.52 teaspoon salt and 0.5 teaspoon black pepper. Then, place the chicken breast in the baking dish. Cover the dish with parchment paper or aluminum foil, and bake for 30-40 minutes. Check that chicken is completely opaque all the way through. Set aside and wait for chicken to cool.
- While chicken is cooling, make the salad dressing by combining 0.25 teaspoon salt, 0.25 teaspoon black pepper, plain Greek yogurt, mayonnaise, lime juice, salsa and chili powder in a bowl. Stir with a spoon until all ingredients are combined.
- When chicken breast is cool enough to handle, slice the chicken into cubes about 0.25- to 0.5-inch in size.
- To make the salad, combine black beans, corn kernels and cubed chicken. Drizzle salad dressing on top of salad and mix together until well combined. Garnish with lime wedges if desired.
