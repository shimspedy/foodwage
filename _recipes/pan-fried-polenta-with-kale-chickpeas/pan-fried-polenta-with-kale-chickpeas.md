notes:


ingredients:
- Pan-Fried Polenta with Kale & Chickpeas:

- 1|  tube of pre-cooked polenta
- 3|  tablespoon  olive oil  divided
- 6|  cup  chopped kale  about 6 large handfuls
- 1|  can of chickpeas  drained and rinsed
- 1|  cup  cherry tomatoes  sliced into quarters
- Enchilada sauce or pasta sauce  to taste
- Grated parmesan  to taste
- Salt and pepper  to taste

directions:
- Slice the polenta into 1/3-inch thick rounds. Be careful not to slice too thin or they’ll be difficult to handle when you fry them. Set aside.
- Massage 1 tablespoon of olive oil into the chopped kale. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Line a medium baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread kale on top of the sheet and bake for 8–10 minutes at 350ºF (175ºC), until leaves start to crisp. If you prefer crunchier kale, leave it in the oven for a few more minutes.
- Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a sauté pan or skillet over medium heat. Spread half of the sliced polenta rounds in the pan. Pan fry each side for 3–4 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining olive oil and polenta rounds.
- While the pan is still hot, pour the enchilada sauce in the pan to warm it up. Turn off the heat after a few minutes.
- Serve polenta rounds with roasted kale, sliced tomatoes, chickpeas, enchilada sauce and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
