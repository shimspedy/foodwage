ingredients:
- Workout Fueling Feta Bison Burgers:

- 1|  egg
- 0.5|  cup  crumbled feta cheese
- 0.25|  cup  almond flour (or almond meal)
- 1|  tablespoon  dried oregano
- 2|  cloves garlic  minced
- 0.25|  teaspoon  fine sea salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  ground black pepper
- ground bison (buffalo) or ground beef, lamb or turkey
- 4|  whole-wheat pitas or hamburger buns
- avocados  optional
- Humus  optional

directions:
- Preheat the grill to medium-high.
- In a large mixing bowl, combine the egg, feta, almond flour, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. Add the meat and use your hands to combine, being careful not to overwork the meat. Form into 4 equal-size patties about 1 inch (2,5 cm) thick.
- Grill the burgers, flipping once, until a thermometer in the center registers 160°F (70°C) and the meat is no longer pink, 3–4 minutes per side. In the last minute, warm the pitas or buns on the grill.
- Split the pitas or buns open, stuff each with a burger, and top (if desired) with avocado or hummus.

Preheat the oven to 375°F. Dry the chicken thighs completely with paper towels, and season with salt and pepper. Add the oil to a large ovenproof skillet, swirling the pan to distribute the oil. Turn to medium heat, and add the chicken thighs, browning on one side (roughly 5 minutes) before flipping to the other side. The chicken is done when it’s nicely browned all over. Add the sake, cover tightly with aluminum foil and transfer the pan to the oven. Bake until the chicken is tender and cooked through, roughly 30–45 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes before pulling meat from the bones, then add to your ramen.
