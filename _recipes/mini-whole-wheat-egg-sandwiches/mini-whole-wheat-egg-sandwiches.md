notes:

ingredients:
- egg patties:

- 4| large eggs
- 0.5| cup  egg whites  (approx. 4 large eggs)
- 0.5| cup  shredded manchego cheese  (or cheese of your choice)
- 3| slices deli ham
- 0.25| teaspoon salt
- 0.25| teaspoon  ground pepper

- whole wheat biscuits:

- 2| cups whole wheat flour
- 0.25| cup  finely chopped green onion
- 2| teaspoons baking powder
-   1| teaspoon salt
- 0.25| teaspoon dried oregano
- 0.25| teaspoon dried basil
- 0.25| cup cold butter  (1/2 a stick)
- 2| tablespoons melted butter for brushing on top
- 0.75| cup fat-free milk

- Optional Ingredients:

- Sliced avocados
- Sliced tomatoes
- Baby spinach
directions:
- To make the egg patties, preheat oven to 350°F. Heavily grease a standard sized muffin tin and set aside. Then, add all ingredients for egg patties to a medium sized bowl and whisk to combine completely. Fill each muffin tin 1/2 way and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and the egg is cooked throughout.
- Set the egg patties aside. Then raise the oven temperature to 425°F and let oven preheat.
- In the mean time, make the whole wheat biscuits. Grease a baking sheet and set aside. Add all ingredients except butter and milk to a medium sized bowl and whisk to combine. Add 1/4 cup butter and use two knives or a pastry cutter to chop butter into small pieces until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk and stir until just moist (dough will be sticky).
- Place dough onto a heavily floured surface and fold over/knead lightly 5 times with floured hands. Flatten dough to a 0.5 inch thickness and cut into biscuits using a biscuit cutter, cookie cutter, or cup, pushing straight down and then twisting slightly. The biscuits will not spread at all so you want to use a small size to keep the biscuits mini. Gently reform dough and make more biscuits until dough is finished (the last biscuit will be a weird shape but I didn’t want to waste dough).
- Place biscuits on the greased baking sheet with the edges touching and brush remaining butter on top of each biscuit. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.    
- Assemble the biscuit with the egg patties and optional ingredients (e.g. tomato, spinach, avocado) of your choice.
