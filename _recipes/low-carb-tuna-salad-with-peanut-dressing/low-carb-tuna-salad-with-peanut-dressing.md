A convenient, high-protein pantry staple, canned tuna can get repetitive and boring with mayonnaise as its main sidekick. Instead, try Uproot Kitchenâ€™s tuna salad, which uses a nutty, sweet sesame-peanut dressing. To add this healthy green meal to your lunchtime rotation, simply pack the salad and dressing in separate airtight containers.
