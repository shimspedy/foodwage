notes:

ingredients:
- Oatmeal:

- 2| cups  frozen blueberries
- 0.25| cup sugar
- 1| teaspoon grated lemon rind
- 1| tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 0.5| teaspoon  ground cinnamon  divided
- 4| cups water
- 1| cup steel-cut oats  (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 0.25| teaspoon salt
- 1| tablespoon butter

directions:
- OVERNIGHT ALERT! Prepping steel cut oats the night before reduces cooking time the next morning. Marinating blueberry compote overnight helps it soak in more sweetness.
- Combine blueberries, sugar, rind, juice, and 0.25 teaspoon cinnamon in a medium bowl; toss to coat. Refrigerate.
- Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in remaining 0.25 teaspoon cinnamon, oats, and salt; cook 1 minute. Remove oat mixture from heat, cover, and refrigerate in pan overnight.
    
-   THE NEXT DAY:
    
-  Bring blueberry mixture to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Cook 6 minutes or until slightly thickened, stirring frequently. Bring oat mixture to a boil over medium-high heat; cook 5 minutes or until thoroughly heated, stirring frequently. Add butter to oat mixture.
- Spoon 0.75 cup oatmeal into each of 4 bowls; top each serving with 0.25 cup blueberry compote.
