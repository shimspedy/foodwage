ingredients:

- 1|  can  no-salt added chickpeas  drained
- 1|  tbsp  fresh rosemary  chopped and divided
- 3|  tbsp  olive oil  divided
- 2|  tbsp  balsamic vinegar
- 1|  clove  garlic  pressed
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 4|  cup  cubed sweet potato  from about 2 medium potatoes
- 4|  cups  chopped kale
- 0.25|  cup  walnuts  coarsely chopped

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF (205ºC). Place the drained chickpeas on a kitchen towel and fold the towel over, to enclose the chickpeas. Rub gently and open up the towel, the skins of the chickpeas should have loosened so you can remove them. This step really improves the texture of the chickpeas. Place the skinned chickpeas on a sheet pan.
- Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over the chickpeas, add 2 teaspoons of the chopped rosemary and toss to coat. Place the pan in the oven and roast for 25–30 minutes.
- When the chickpeas are crunchy,remove the pan and cool on a rack. When cool, transfer to a bowl and chill, if not eating immediately.
- In a cup, whisk the remaining olive oil, balsamic vinegar, reserved teaspoon of rosemary, garlic and salt, reserve.
- Cube the sweet potatoes and place in a steamer, steam over simmering water for 5 minutes, until the sweet potato is tender when pierced with a paring knife. Transfer the sweet potatoes to four wide, low bowls.
- Over the same simmering water, steam the kale for about 2 minutes. Transfer the kale to a kitchen towel and pat dry, then place on the cutting board and chop. Arrange the kale on top of the sweet potatoes.
- Arrange 0.25 of the chickpeas atop each bowl and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of dressing. Top with chopped walnuts and serve.
