notes:
- La Choy soy sauce is gluten-free

ingredients:
- Smoked Drumsticks with Sriracha Honey Lime Sauce:

- 2|  pounds drumsticks
- 1.5|  tablespoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 1|  tablespoon  honey
- 1|  teaspoon  Sriracha
- 0.5|  teaspoon  garlic  minced
- Zest of one lime
- Juice from half a lime

directions:
- Heat a grill to 375°F.
- Place the plain drumsticks directly on the grill and let cook for 25 minutes, turning once while cooking.
- Meanwhile, combine sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and let simmer over medium-low heat while the drumsticks are cooking. Heat the mixture (don’t boil), so the flavors meld and the sauce thickens a bit.
- Remove drumsticks from grill and place in a large bowl with a lid. Pour the sauce over the drumsticks, place the lid on bowl tightly and shake the bowl to evenly coat the drumsticks.
- Garnish drumsticks with any leftover sauce, sesame seeds and additional lime zest if desired.
