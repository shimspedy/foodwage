notes:


ingredients:
- Blueberry Oat Muffin:

- 1|  cup  all-purpose flour  1 tablespoon
- cup  old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1.5|  teaspoon  baking powder
- 0.5|  teaspoon  baking soda
- 0.5|  teaspoon  ground cinnamon
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 1|  large  egg
- 1|  cup  plain Greek yogurt
- 0.25|  cup  honey
- 2|  tablespoon  coconut palm sugar  optional
- 0.25|  cup  unsweetened almond milk
- 2|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- 1|  cup  blueberries  frozen or fresh

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C), and prepare a muffin pan by coating the cups with cooking spray or greasing them with oil. Set aside.
- In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the oats, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.
- In a separate bowl, beat the egg until it becomes slightly frothy. Whisk in the yogurt, honey, sugar, almond milk and vanilla, mixing until well-combined.
- Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing gently until just combined. Toss the blueberries with 1 tablespoon of flour to prevent them from bleeding or sinking to the bottom of the muffins, and fold them into the batter.
- Divide the batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups, filling almost to the top. Add a sprinkle of coconut sugar, if desired.
- Bake for 20–22 minutes, or until the tops of the muffins are firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
- Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
- You can also use a mix of all-purpose and whole-wheat flour or sub oat flour, but the texture will be slightly denser and moister.
