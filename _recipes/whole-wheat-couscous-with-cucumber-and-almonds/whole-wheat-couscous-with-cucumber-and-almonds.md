Whole-grain (Read: high-fiber) foods keep you full longer — and one of the easiest whole-grain foods to prepare is whole-wheat couscous. Like a tiny pasta, whole-wheat couscous absorbs water quickly, and cooks in 5 minutes. The tender grains are perfect for chilled salads like this one, studded with crunchy almonds and bathed in lemony vinaigrette.
