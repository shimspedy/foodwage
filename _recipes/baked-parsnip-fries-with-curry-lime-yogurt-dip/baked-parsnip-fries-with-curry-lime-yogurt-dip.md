ingredients:
- Baked Parsnip Fries with Curry-Lime Yogurt Dip:

- 1|  tablespoon  canola or olive oil
- 3|  cloves garlic  minced
- 8|  medium parsnips  peeled
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  coarse black pepper
- 0.25|  cup  grated Parmesan cheese
- 1|  tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
- 0.5|  cup  plain low-fat Greek yogurt
- 1|  tablespoon  fresh lime juice
- 1|  teaspoon  curry powder
- 1|  teaspoon  ground cumin

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with nonstick foil or parchment; set aside.
- Heat oil in a small skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook 2–3 minutes. Strain garlic and set aside. Pour oil into a medium bowl.
- Cut parsnips into 3 1/2-inch strips about 1/4-inch thick. Add parsnips, salt, and pepper to bowl, tossing to coat. Spread out in a single layer on prepared baking sheet.
- Bake 20 minutes, turning once, until golden brown and slightly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Remove from baking sheet, and immediately toss with Parmesan cheese, parsley and reserved garlic.
- While parsnips bake, stir together yogurt, juice, curry and cumin. Serve immediately, with the parsnips.

Parsnips are carrots’ forgotten beige cousins. These sweet, starchy root veggies are full of fiber, potassium and vitamin C. Our garlic parsnip fries are topped with Parmesan and a spicy curry lime yogurt dip that will make you forget about fast food.
