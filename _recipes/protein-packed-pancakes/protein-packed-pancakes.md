notes:

ingredients:
- Protein-Packed Pancakes:

- 0.5|  cup  all-purpouse flour
- 1.5| tsp  sugar
- 1|  tsp  baking powder
- 0.25| tsp  salt
- 2|  large egg  50 grams per egg
- 1|  tsp  vanilla extract
- 1|  cup  2% fat greek yogurt
- 0.33|  cup  fresh blueberries  for garnish
directions:
- Add dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder and salt) to a bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the wet ingredients (eggs, vanilla extract and Greek yogurt) until well mixed.
- Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir together until well combined.
- Spray your pan or griddle with cooking spray and place onto stove on medium-low heat. Use a 1/4 cup to portion out pancakes that are about 4 inches in diameter.
- Cook pancakes until the bottom side is brown (about 3-4 minutes), then flip the pancakes. You’ll notice that these pancakes won’t bubble up like traditional pancakes. Leave extra room in the pan because the pancakes may splatter when you flip them.
- After flipping the pancake, cook until the other side is brown (about 2-3 minutes). Repeat with remaining batter.
- Top pancakes with blueberries, and enjoy

If you shy away from pancakes because they don’t have enough protein, these moist protein-packed pancakes were made for you! Greek yogurt is thick, creamy and a popular lean protein that gives this dish a tangy flavor. Each satisfying stack of pancakes is topped with fresh blueberries. You can also serve with a ripe banana or maple syrup if desired.
