notes:


ingredients:
- Breakfast Flatbread Pizza:

- 1|  medium  slice center-cut bacon
- 2|  large  eggs  50 grams each
- 1|  large  pita flatbread
- 1|  teaspoon  cream cheese  reduced fat (1/3 less fat)
- 1|  tablespoon  diced red onion
- 1|  tablespoon  diced bell pepper
- 1|  mushroom  sliced
- 1|  tablespoon  diced tomatoes
- 1|  tablespoon  shredded cheddar cheese
- 0.5|  teaspoon  chopped chives

directions:
- Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil, and cook bacon for 7 minutes. Blot grease and allow to cool, then slice and set aside.
- Scramble the eggs, but don’t cook all the way through. They need to be moist because they’ll finish cooking in the oven.
- Place flatbread on baking sheet and spread with cream cheese. Top evenly with eggs, bacon, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, tomatoes and cheddar cheese.
- Bake in 400 degree F oven for 8 minutes until flatbread is crispy and cheese is melted. Sprinkle with chives and slice into four triangles while hot.

Who says you can’t have pizza for breakfast? Love & Zest says you CAN. This high-protein flatbread version packs plenty of flavor with sweet bell peppers, fluffy eggs and gooey cheddar cheese. Prep and store the ingredients in neat tupperware ahead of time so you can pop them in the oven, and start your day off right!
