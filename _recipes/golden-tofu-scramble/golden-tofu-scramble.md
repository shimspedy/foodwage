ingredients:
- Golden Tofu Scramble:

- firm or extra-firm tofu  pressed and drained
- 2|  teaspoon  avocado or coconut oil
- 2|  cloves garlic  minced
- 1|  cup  red onion  finely chopped
- 1|  cup  button mushrooms  chopped
- 2|  teaspoon  turmeric
- 2|  teaspoons  cumin
- 1|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.5|  teaspoon  ground pepper
- 1|  cup  shredded kale or baby spinach
- 0.25|  cup  nutritional yeast
- Hot sauce  to taste (optional)

directions:
- Add oil to a large skillet set over medium heat. Once hot, add garlic and onion, cooking for about 3–4 minutes or until onions begin to soften.
- Add mushrooms to the pan, then use your fingers to crumble the tofu into chunks before tossing it into the pan as well. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the tofu starts to stick or the pan becomes dry, add a little water to the pan.
- Add the turmeric, cumin, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Then add the kale and nutritional yeast. Stir and cook for an additional 3–4 minutes. Taste and season with additional black pepper and sea salt, if needed. Serve the scramble warm with sliced avocado and fresh herbs.
