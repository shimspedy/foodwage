ingredients:
- Gnocchi

- 1| pound  95% lean ground beef
- 1| teaspoon salt
- 1| teaspoon fennel seeds
- 0.25| teaspoon  black pepper
- 0.5| teaspoon red chili/pepper flakes
- 2| cloves  garlic
- 1| diced medium onion
- 1| bunch kale  leaves and stems separated
- 1| pound gnocchi
- 2| tablespoons olive oil
- 1| tablespoon cooking oil
- 0.33| cup tomato paste
- 0.5| lemon  juiced
- to taste  Parmesan cheese  Optional

directions:
- Season the ground meat with salt, fennel seeds, black pepper, and red chili flakes. This can be done 1 day ahead.
- To prepare the gnocchi, bring a saucepan of water to boil. Salt heavily (that water should taste like the ocean!) and add gnocchi. Cook according to package instructions. Drain, toss with 2 tbs. of olive oil, and set aside.
- Heat a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add cooking oil and then garlic to heated oil. Once you can smell the garlic, add the kale stems and onions with a dash of salt. Saute until softened or approximately 3 minutes.
- Add in ground meat and tomato paste, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Cook meat until brown or approximately 5 to 7 minutes.
- Add in kale leaves, as much as can fit into the pan. With each addition, add a pinch of salt. Saute until all the kale leaves are in the pan and wilted.
- Add gnocchi back into the pan, toss everything through, and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve warm with parmesan cheese.
