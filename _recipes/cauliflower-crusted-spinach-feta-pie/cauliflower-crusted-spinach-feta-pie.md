notes:

ingredients:
- For the crust:

- 1|  large  head cauliflower cut into 8 cups (1920 ml) florets
- 1|  tablespoon  Parmesan cheese  shredded
- 2|  large  egg whites

- For the filling:

- 6|  large  egg whites
- 2|  large  eggs
- 10|  ounces  frozen spinach  thawed and drained
- 0.75|  cup  feta cheese  crumbled
- 0.25|  cup  green onion  chopped
- 1| teaspoon  dried oregano
- 0.5|  teaspoon  ground black pepper

directions:
- For the crust
- Preheat the oven to 400°F, and coat a a deep, 9-inch pie pan with cooking spray, reserve. Spread a clean tea towel on the counter for draining the cauliflower.
- Place the cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and heat 5 minutes on high. The cauliflower should be tender. Transfer half of the cauliflower to a food processor and process mincing finely. Dump the cauliflower on the clean tea towel, and repeat with the remaining cauliflower. Use a spatula to spread the cauliflower in a loose layer over the tea towel and let cool for 10 minutes.
- While it cools, whisk the 2 egg whites with the parmesan in a medium bowl. When the cauliflower has cooled, pull up the edges of the towel and make a bundle, and press and knead the cauliflower over the sink to remove as much water as possible. Wring and twist the towel to squeeze out all the moisture; it will take a few minutes. When nearly dry, transfer the cauliflower to the bowl with the egg whites and stir to mix. Spoon into the oiled pie pan and press down with the back of the spoon to form a crust, making a rim about half an inch above the edge of the pan. Bake for 15-20 minutes. The edge will be browned and the bottom will look dry.
- For the filling    
- Whisk the remaining egg whites and the whole eggs in a large bowl. Wring the water from the spinach and add to the eggs along with the feta, green onions, oregano and pepper. Stir to mix, and pour into the baked shell. Smooth the top and bake for about 35–40 minutes, until the top is puffed in the center and the eggs are cooked through. Cool on a rack for five minutes before slicing into 7 pieces

Rich, buttery spanakopita is a favorite at Greek restaurants, but a slice packs a hefty caloric punch. Luckily, the delicious combination of spinach and feta is just as alluring when lightened up and baked in a cauliflower crust. Naturally gluten-free, cauliflower makes a great alternative to flour-and-butter crusts and adds even more veggie servings to the pie.
