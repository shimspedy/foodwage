notes:

ingredients:
- Spaghetti Squash:

- 3|  ounce  cooked Chicken Breast  1 breast, cut into chunks
- 1|  medium Spaghetti Squash  about 4 cups cooked
- 1|  cup  Kidney Beans  drained and rinsed
- 3|  tablespoons fresh Coriander  chopped
- 0.5|  cup  Cheddar Cheese  Shredded
- to taste  Sea Salt
- to taste  Pepper
- 1|  tablespoon  Chili Flakes  optional

directions:
- Preheat your oven to 425°F and line your baking sheet with parchment.
- Cut the squash in half, rub with inside with olive oil and sprinkle sea salt & pepper. Place face down on the baking sheet & bake for about 25-30 minutes. The edges on the inside should be a bit browned and shreds should form easily with a fork.
- Meanwhile, toss the chili flakes with the cheeses and stir the fresh coriander into the salsa.
- When the squash is ready, take it out and let it stand for 5 minutes. Turn the oven to the broiler setting. Fully shred the squash, leaving the shell intact. You will be stuffing it!
- Transfer the spaghetti squash to a mixing bowl. Stir in the salsa, followed by the beans and chicken. Split the mixture in half and stuff each squash shell. Top with the shredded cheese.
- Place them back on the same baking sheet & broil until bubbly and browned. About 3-4 minutes.

Instead of scraping the delights out of the shell and tossing it away, we’re giving the entire squash the credit it deserves. This Tex-Mex Baked Spaghetti Squash from The Honour System is stuffed with protein-packed beans and chili-lime chicken. Toss in some spice via salsa, fresh cilantro, and top it all off with a unique cheese blend and you’ve got a delicious dinner.
