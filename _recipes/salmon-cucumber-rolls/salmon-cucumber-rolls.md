notes:

ingredients:
- Salmon Cucumber Rolls:

- 3|  large  English cucumbers
- 2|  can  wild-caught salmon, drained
- 1|  small  carrot, grated
- 0.25|  cup  loosely packed dill
- 0.5|  medium  lemon, juiced
- 0.25|  teaspoon  black pepper
- Toothpicks,  to secure the rolls
- Sunflower sprouts  to garnish

directions:
- Using a sharp knife, trim the ends off of the cucumbers.
- Starting at one end, cut a thin strip off of the cucumber, trying to keep the thickness even. It might take a few slices until you start to get them right, but it’s not difficult. Alternatively, you can use a mandoline slicer. You’ll need about 10–12 strips.
- Drain the salmon; in a bowl, mash it with the back of a fork. Add the grated carrot, dill, lemon juice and black pepper. Stir until incorporated.
- Using a spoon, scoop up about 2 tablespoons of the salmon mixture and pack it into a ball. Place it at one end of a cucumber strip, then roll the cucumber up as shown in the recipe photo.
- Secure the roll with a toothpick, then place a few sunflower sprouts on the top.
- Repeat for all remaining rolls and salmon.
