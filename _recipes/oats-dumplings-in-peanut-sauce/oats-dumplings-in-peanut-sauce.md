Cilok, chewy dumplings in spicy peanut sauce, is a popular Indonesian street food. In this recipe, we make the dumplings using oats and tapioca starch to create a signature chewy texture and mix in ground toasted dried shrimp, scallions, garlic, salt, sugar and pepper to add a flavorful umami taste. We then boil the dumplings until cooked and serve with a quick and spicy peanut sauce.
