ingredients:
- Spiced Carrot and Beet Cupcakes:

- 1|  cup  gluten-free flour blend Bob’s Red Mill Gluten-Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour
- 2|  tbsp  hulled hemp seed hearts
- 1.5|  tbsp  pumpkin pie spice
- 0.75|  tsp  baking powder
- 0.25|  tsp  baking soda
- 0.25|  tsp  salt
- 0.5|  cup  maple syrup
- 7|  tbsp  olive oil
- 2|  large  eggs
- 2| tsp  orange zest  finely grated
- 1|  tsp  vanilla extract
- 0.75|  cup  golden beets  grated
- 0.25|  cup  toasted walnuts  chopped

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners or coat with cooking spray.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, hemp seed hearts, pie spice, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, oil, eggs, orange zest and vanilla. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and gently stir with a rubber spatula until most of the flour is absorbed. Fold in the grated carrots, beets and nuts; do not overmix.
- Spoon the batter into the prepared cupcake tin and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cupcakes cool in the baking tin for 10 minutes. Remove cupcakes from pan and cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week

These gluten-free cupcakes are packed with grated carrots and golden beets to add nutrients, sweetness and moistness. We’ve swapped maple syrup for refined sugar and heart-healthy olive oil for butter to make these treats better for you. Be sure to use a mild-flavored olive oil; save your best extra-virgin oil for salads.
