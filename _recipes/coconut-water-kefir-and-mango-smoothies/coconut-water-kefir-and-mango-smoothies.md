Water kefir is a probiotic beverage made with water kefir grains, which are a symbiotic mix of beneficial bacteria and yeast. Water kefir grains are available via mail order and require a simple activation step before they can be used to make homemade water kefir. Follow manufacturer’s instructions to “wake up” the grains. Once activated, water kefir grains can be used to make homemade probiotic drinks, from this simple single fermented kefir water to effervescent double-fermented sodas.
In this recipe, we use homemade, electrolyte-packed coconut water to make a single-fermented kefir water, frozen mango and turmeric smoothie for a sunny, tropical start to your day.
