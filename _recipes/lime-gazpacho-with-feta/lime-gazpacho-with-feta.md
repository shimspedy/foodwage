Gazpacho is a refreshing summer soup, full of crunchy cucumber and juicy tomatoes. By adding fresh mint and lime juice, it tastes a little more like a Mexican-style soup, and a crumble of savory feta adds a savory counterpoint. To reduce sodium, soak the feta cheese in cold water for an hour and drain, pat dry before adding to the soup in the bowl.
