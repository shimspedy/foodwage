notes:


ingredients:
- Chorizo Tomato & Egg Breakfast Skillet:

- 2|  tablespoon  butter or oil
- 0.5|  cup  chopped chorizo
- 2|  medium onions  diced
- 4|  roma tomatoes  chopped
- 2|  cloves garlic  minced
- A small splash of red wine
- large eggs
- Salt and pepper  to taste

directions:
- Heat the oil in a medium-sized skillet over medium high heat. Add the chopped chorizo and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the onion and continue to cook for 3 minutes, or until the onion is soft. Add the tomatoes, garlic and a small splash of red wine and cook until it is hot and bubbly.
- Reduce the heat to low. Using your spatula create little wells in the tomato chorizo sauce for your eggs to sit in. Carefully crack the eggs into the wells.
- Cook the eggs, uncovered, for 3â€“5 minutes, or until the whites are cooked through and the yolks are still runny. Keep them on the heat a few extra minutes if you would like your eggs less runny.
- Remove the skillet from the heat, season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
