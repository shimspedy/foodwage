ingredients:
- Stuffed Tomatoes:

- 3| large tomatoes  3.5 or 4 inches (10cm) across
- 3| tablespoons  Veganaise or other eggless mayonnaise
- 1| tablespoon  Dijon mustard
- 1| teaspoon  dried dill
- 0.5| teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
- 0.25| teaspoon  turmeric
- 1|  large green onion  finely chopped
- 1|  rib celery  finely chopped
- 3|  sprigs fresh parsley,  for garnish
directions:
- Prep the tomatoes. Spread a kitchen towel on a large plate and reserve. Use a paring knife to cut a circle in the top of the tomato and pull out the core. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds, pulp, and flesh from the tomato, leaving the walls. Place the tomato, cut-side down, on the towel-lined plate. Continue until all the tomatoes are draining on the towel.
- Drain the tofu and wrap in a kitchen towel. Place a heavy pot on the tofu to press out the excess liquid.
- In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, dill, pepper and turmeric. Stir to mix well. Add the green onions and celery and crumble the tofu into the bowl. Stir gently to mix.
- Spoon about 0.5 cup filling into each tomato, rounding the top. Place on a serving plate and garnish each tomato with a parsley sprig. Serve immediately, or cover tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days.

Tofu, crumbled and seasoned, makes a tasty “egg” salad, with lots of protein and no cholesterol. It makes a pretty, summery side salad when stuffed in a juicy tomato and provides 45% of your daily vitamin C and 37% of vitamin A.
