ingredients:
- Ground Turkey Stuffed Tomatoes:

- 8|  large  tomatoes, washed  180 grams each
- 2|  teaspoon  olive oil
- 0.5|  pound  85% lean ground turkey
- 2|  garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1|  medium  zucchini, diced
- 0.5|  medium  onion, diced
- 1|  teaspoon  dried oregano
- 2|  tablespoon  tomato paste
- 0.5|  cup  uncooked couscous
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.5|  teaspoon  pepper
- Crumbled feta cheese  Optional Topping

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F.
-  Slice the tops off the tomatoes, and set them aside. Use a spoon to scoop out tomato pulp. Deposit tomato pulp into a bowl, and set aside.
- Drizzle olive oil in the bottom of a large glass baking dish. Arrange the tomato shells in the baking dish, and set aside.
- In a medium skillet, sauté meat and garlic over medium-high heat. Once meat is cooked through and no longer pink, add zucchini, onion, oregano, tomato paste and tomato pulp to the skillet. Turn the heat to high, allow mixture to come to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, and add couscous.
- Cook couscous for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Add more water if needed; this may be necessary if your tomato pulp does not have sufficient liquid.
- Add salt and pepper, and mix until well-combined. Use a spoon to taste, and add more salt and pepper if desired.
- Scoop the couscous mixture into the tomato shells, filling them all the way to the top. Pour any excess into the baking pan.
- Place tomato tops back onto the tomatoes, and bake for 30 minutes.
- Sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese if desired, and serve.

Lean ground turkey and couscous are seasoned with Mediterranean flavors then baked in a tangy tomato shell. This dish is great for the summer, when ripe tomatoes are in abundance, but you can also make it all year round. To make this meal more energizing, serve with a whole-grain dinner roll for more calories and carbs.
