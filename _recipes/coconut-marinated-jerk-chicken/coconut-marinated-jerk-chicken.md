ingredients:
- Coconut-Marinated Jerk Chicken:

- 0.75|  cup  water
- 0.5|  cup  orange juice
- 3|  cloves garlic  minced
- 2|  tablespoon  fresh thyme  leaves stripped from stems and chopped
- 1|  tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
- 1|  lime  zested and juiced
- 1.5|  teaspoon  ground allspice
- Pinch crushed red pepper or 1 hot pepper  minced
- 4|  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 0.5|  teaspoon  olive oil
- Sea salt and fresh ground black pepper
- 2|  cup  fresh tropical fruit such as pineapple, mango or papaya, diced

directions:
- In a bowl, whisk all marinade ingredients together. Place 1/4 cup of the marinade in a small resealable plastic bag or container, and refrigerate. Place the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag, then pour in the remaining 3/4 cup marinade. Press out excess air while sealing the bag tightly, then store flat in fridge. Allow chicken to marinate overnight.
- Preheat oven to 400°F.
- Heat a sauté pan on high. Add the oil to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot but not yet smoking, place the chicken in the pan, discarding the remainder of the marinade from the bag. Sear for 2–3 minutes, and flip the chicken. Season the cooked side with salt and pepper, while searing the bottom for an additional 2–3 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan, place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and put in the oven. Roast for 10–12 minutes, or until chicken is fully cooked (no longer pink in the middle).
- While the chicken is in the oven, combine the 1/4 cup reserved marinade and tropical fruit in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate until the chicken is ready.
- Serve the chicken with 1/2 cup fruit mixture.
