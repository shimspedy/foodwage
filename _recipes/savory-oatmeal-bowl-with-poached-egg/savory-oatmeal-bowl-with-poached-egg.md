meal: breakfast
chef: foodwage
time: under 15 mins
servings: 1

notes:
- Adding a touch of vinegar to the poaching water helps the whites to coagulate when cooking.

ingredients:
- Oatmeal:

- 0.5|  cup  old-fashioned rolled oats  1|
- 0.25|  tsp  garlic powder  1|
- 3|  tbsp  shredded sharp cheddar  1|
- 1|  slice  center-cut bacon, cooked and crumbled  5|

- Poached Egg:

- 1|  Egg  1|
- 1|  Dash  Fresh Ground Pepper

directions:
- Combine oats, broth, garlic powder and salt in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1.5 minutes. Stir and microwave on high for an additional 30–60 seconds or until thick, bubbly and most liquid has been absorbed.
- While oatmeal cooking in microwave, bring 3 cups of water to a boil over high heat in a small saucepan. Using a whisk, swirl water in a circular motion until a whirlpool forms. Gently crack egg into center of whirlpool. Cook the egg until white is set, about 3 minutes.
- Using a slotted spoon, remove egg from pan and place on a plate lined with paper towels.
- Remove the oats from the microwave and stir in cheese, tomatoes and 0.5 of the green onions and bacon crumbles. Top with cooked egg. Sprinkle with pepper and remaining green onions and bacon crumbles.
