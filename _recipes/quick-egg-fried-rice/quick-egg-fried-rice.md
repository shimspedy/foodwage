servings: 1

notes:

ingredients:
- Rice:
- 1|  cup  microwaveable rice  cold, leftover rice (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 2|  tablespoons  frozen peas
- 2|  tablespoons  chopped red pepper
- 0.5|  stalk  green onion chopped
- 1|  Small pinch  shredded purple cabbage
- 1|  large egg
- 1|  tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 0.5| teaspoon  sesame oil
- 0.25| teaspoon  onion powder
- 0.25| teaspoon  five-spice powder  optional
- 1|  Small pinch  mung bean sprouts  optional
directions:
- If using microwaveable rice, place the rice into a large mug and cover with cling film. Using a knife, puncture one or two small holes through the film. This step is important! You don’t want to scald yourself. Microwave the rice for a minute.
- If using cold, leftover rice, add 1 tablespoon water.
- Add the vegetables(peas, red pepper, green onion, bean sprouts, and purple cabbage) to the rice. You can add more vegetables as long as the contents don’t spill over the mug. Cover the mug with the cling film, and microwave for another minute.
- In the meantime, beat the egg and mix in the seasoning (soy sauce, sesame oil, onion powder, and five-spice powder). Pour the egg mixture into the mug, and mix well.
- Cover the mug with cling film again, and microwave for another 35 to 40 seconds. Take the mug out of the microwave, and give everything a good stir. The egg should look fully cooked. Let the fried rice stand for a minute before serving. Enjoy!
