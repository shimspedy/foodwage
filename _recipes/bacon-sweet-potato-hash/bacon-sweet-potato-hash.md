ingredients:
- Bacon Sweet-Potato Hash:

- 4|  slice  bacon  28 grams each
- 2|  medium  sweet potatoes  130 grams each (diced into 1/4- to 1/2-inch chunks)
- 0.5|  medium  onion  finely diced
- 1|  spinach bag or container
- Salt and pepper  to taste
- large  eggs  50g each

directions:
- Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat, and add bacon. Cook bacon until the fat is rendered and bacon is crispy. Remove bacon, and set aside.
- Add the sweet potatoes to the skillet and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until potato chunks blacken in bits. Add the onions, and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the spinach, and tear in the bacon slices. Cook until spinach is wilted. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
- Lower the heat to medium-low. Use the spatula to create two holes in the hash mixture. Break one egg into each hole. Cook the eggs until desired doneness.
- Portion out onto 2 plates, and serve.
