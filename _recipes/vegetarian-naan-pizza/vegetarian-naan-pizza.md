ingredients:
- Vegetarian Naan Pizza:

- 0.33333333333|  cup  yogurt
- 1.5|  tablespoon  andoori paste
- 1|  teaspoon  cumin
- 1|  teaspoon  lemon juice
- 1|  medium sweet potato
- 2|  teaspoon  olive oil
- 2|  whole-wheat naan breads
- 2|  collard green leaves
- 0.5|  medium red pepper, sliced into strips
- 0.25|  medium red onion  thinly sliced
- 0.25|  cup  crumbled goat cheese

directions:
- In a small bowl, stir the yogurt, tandoori paste, cumin, and lemon juice. Refrigerate the yogurt mix for at least 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Peel the sweet potato and chop it into 1/2-inch cubes. Toss the sweet potatoes with olive oil, and bake for 23-25 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork. Take the sweet potatoes out of the oven, and increase the heat to 400 degrees F. Remove the sweet potatoes and the parchment paper. Line the baking sheet with a fresh piece of parchment paper.
- Stem the leaves of the collard greens from the stalk. Chop them into 1/2-inch thick ribbons.
- Time to assemble the flatbread pizza. Spread the yogurt sauce onto both pieces of naan. Lay the toppings (collard greens, red pepper, sliced red onions, goat cheese, and sweet potatoes) on top of the naan.
- Bake the flatbread pizza for 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges of the naan are browned.
- Serve immediately and refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.

Treat naan like a flatbread base for this vegetarian pizza from Healthy Nibbles & Bits. Piled high with collard greens, red pepper and onion, this meal has 13 grams of fiber per serving. Note: using store-bought naan is a convenient swap when you donâ€™t have time to make fresh pizza dough.
