ingredients:
- Slow Cooker Chocolate Swirl Bread:

- Baking spray
- 1|  cup  all-purpose flour
- 0.75|  teaspoon  baking soda
- 0.25|  teaspoon  kosher salt
- 2|  tablespoon  unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 0.5|  cup  packed light brown sugar
- 3|  overripe medium bananas  mashed
- 2|  tablespoon  unsweetened applesauce
- 2|  large  egg whites
- 1|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- 0.25|  cup  semisweet chocolate chips

directions:
- Lightly coat an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan with baking spray. Place a small rack or 3–4 foil balls in the bottom of a slow cooker.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.
- In a large bowl, beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer. Add the bananas, applesauce, egg whites and vanilla, and beat on medium speed until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the flour mixture, and mix on low speed until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
- Place the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave in 15-second increments, stirring after each, until the chips are melted. Add dollops of the melted chocolate to the top of the batter. Using a butter knife, swirl the chocolate into the batter. Place the pan in the slow cooker on the rack and cover.
- Cover and cook on high for 2 1/2–3 hours, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the pan from the slow cooker, and let cool in the pan at least 20 minutes before turning the bread out of the pan. Cut into 12 slices to serve.
- Alternatively, you can bake in oven at 350°F for about 50 minutes.

Are your bananas too ripe (and black)? Don’t let them go to waste; instead, use them in this slow-cooker chocolate swirl bread from Skinnytaste! Overripe bananas are very sweet, which means you can cut back on the sugar in recipes without missing any sweetness. This recipe is great during the warmer months when you don’t want to heat up your kitchen by turning on the oven.
