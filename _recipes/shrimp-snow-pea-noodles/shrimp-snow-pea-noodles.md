ingredients:
- Shrimp & Snow Pea Noodles:

- dry rice noodles
- 2|  tbsp  olive oil

- 0.5|  small yellow onion  sliced

directions:
- Soak the noodles in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes.
- Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and let it cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the shrimp curls and turns orange. Pour the cooked shrimp on a plate, and wipe the pan down with a towel.
- Heat another tablespoon of olive oil in the pan. Add the onions. When they start to turn translucent, add the snow peas. Cover the pan with a lid for 2 to 3 minutes. If it looks like the pan is very dry, add a few tablespoons of water. Uncover the pan and add the mung beans sprouts and stir for another minute or 2.
