ingredients:
- Greek Chicken Sheet Pan Dinner:

- 2|  medium  lemons
- 4|  boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- red potatoes,  cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
- 12|  small heirloom carrots  trimmed
- 2|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  tablespoon  fresh oregano  plus 1 teaspoon, divided
- 1.25|  teaspoon  kosher salt  divided
- 1|  teaspoon  garlic powder
- Black pepper  to taste
- 1.5| ounces crumbled feta cheese 
- 1|  tablespoon  grated lemon zest

directions:
- Adjust the oven racks in the center and bottom third, and preheat the oven to 450°F (232ºC). Line two large rimmed baking sheets with foil and spray with oil.
- Slice one lemon into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Cut the second lemon in half.
- In a large bowl, combine chicken, potatoes, carrots, juice from 1/2 lemon, olive oil, 1 tablespoon oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, garlic powder and pepper to taste, and toss well with hands until everything is evenly coated. Spread out in a single layer along with the lemon slices, without overcrowding, onto the prepared baking sheets.
- Roast until the bottoms of the potatoes are golden, about 14 minutes. Flip the potatoes and carrots, rotate the baking sheets and roast until carrots are tender, potatoes are golden on both sides and chicken is cooked through, another 14 minutes.
- Squeeze the remaining 1/2 lemon over everything. Top with feta, lemon zest, 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon oregano. Serve immediately.
