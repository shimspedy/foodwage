categories:  salad
tags: salad
meal: Breakfast
chef: foodwage
time: under 20 mins
servings: 4

notes:
-  If you can’t find fingerling potatoes feel free to use red-skinned or yellow potatoes cut into 2″ pieces. If you don’t have rice wine vinegar you can use any other sweet vinegar such as white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar.

ingredients:
- peppered bacon:
-   4| slices  thick sliced bacon  cut in half
-   2| teaspoons coarse ground black pepper
- warm herbed potatoes:
-   12| ounces  fingerling potatoes
-   1| teaspoon  kosher salt
-   1|  medium shallot  finely minced
-   1|  tablespoon  fresh parsley  finely minced
-   1| tablespoon  fresh chives  finely chopped
- maple dijon vinaigrette:
-   1| teaspoon  stone ground mustard
-   2| tablespoons  pure maple syrup
-   3| tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
-   2| tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
-   1|  Pinch  salt
- salad:
-   12| cups  mixed salad greens
-   1| cup  grape tomatoes  quartered
-   4| large eggs  cooked to order
- 
directions:
- Sprinkle the bacon all over on both sides with the black pepper. Cook it in a medium skillet until crisp on both sides. Place the bacon on a paper towel to drain and then remove all the grease from the pan except for about a tablespoon. 
- In a medium stock pot cover the potatoes with water, plus about an inch. Add the kosher salt to the water. Bring it to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender — about 7 minutes. Drain the water and put them back in the stock pot. 
- Bring the bacon grease back up to temperature over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook them until translucent, 1-2 minutes. Scrape the cooked shallots and remaining bacon grease into the stock pot with the potatoes and toss to coat. Stir in the parsley and chives.
- To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the mustard, maple syrup, and rice wine vinegar. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, whisking constantly. Stir in the pinch of salt. 
- Place the salad greens and tomatoes in a large bowl. Pour in the vinaigrette and toss to coat. Add the bacon and warm potatoes. Cook the eggs to order and place on top of each salad as you are serving.

Courtesy of Food Fanatic, this brunch-worthy breakfast salad is truly a marriage of two meals. Peppered bacon, warm herbed potatoes, and egg are served on a bed of green salad. Assembly is required, but it’s going to be worth it.
