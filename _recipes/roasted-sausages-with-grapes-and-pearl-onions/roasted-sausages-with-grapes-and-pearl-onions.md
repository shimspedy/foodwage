Add the grapes, pearl onions and rosemary. Drizzle with a little more olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

Fresh sausage is the ultimate convenience food — it’s pre-seasoned and ready to cook. This recipe is incredibly elegant, but the sausage and minimal ingredients make it a cinch to pull off for last-minute guests.
Be sure to buy the best sausage since they provide most of the flavor. The juices from the pork seep out and baste the grapes and pearl onions until they are tender and savory. Traditionally this dish is finished with balsamic vinegar, but pomegranate molasses adds a pleasant sour tang, and the thick syrup coats the sausages and grapes beautifully. Serve with good bread, polenta or a simple green salad.
