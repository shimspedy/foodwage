ingredients:
- Baked Banana French Toast:

- 3|  medium  bananas  120 grams each or peeled and sliced, divided
- 6|  slices  reduced-calorie whole-grain bread  sliced in half diagonally
- 4|  large  eggs  50 grams each
- 4|  large  egg whites  30 grams each
- 1|  cup  low-fat (1%) milk
- 2|  tablespoon  firmly packed light brown sugar
- 1|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- 0.75|  teaspoon  cinnamon
- 2|  tablespoon  chopped pecans  optional
- 2|  tablespoon  pure maple syrup

directions:
- Coat an 11-by-7-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Spread slices from 2 bananas evenly in the bottom; layer the bread on top, overlapping as necessary. Arrange the remaining bananas on top of the bread.
- Whisk together the eggs, egg whites, milk, brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Pour the egg mixture over the bread, covering it and pushing the slices down so they are coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.
- Preheat oven to 350°F.
- Sprinkle the French toast dish with pecans, if desired. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until puffed and light golden brown. Cool 5 minutes before serving. Drizzle each serving with 1 teaspoon maple syrup.
