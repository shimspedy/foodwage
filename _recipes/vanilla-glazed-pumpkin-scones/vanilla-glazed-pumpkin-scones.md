ingredients:
- For the Scones:

- Cooking spray or oil mister
- 0.5|  cup  cold lowfat 1% buttermilk
- 1|  large  egg
- 1|  tsp  pure vanilla extract
- 5|  tbsp  canned pumpkin puree not pumpkin pie filling
- 0.25|  cup  packed dark brown sugar
- 1|  vanilla bean
- 1|  cup  white whole wheat flour
- 1|  cup  unbleached all-purpose flour  plus more for the work surface
- 1|  tsp  baking powder
- 2|  tsp  pumpkin pie spice
- 0.25|  tsp  ground nutmeg
- 0.25|  tsp  ground cinnamon
- 0.5|  tsp  kosher salt
- 3|  tbsp  very cold butter, cut into small pieces

- For the Glaze:

- 2|  tbsp  cold fat-free milk
- 1|  cup  powdered sugar,  sifted
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375°F. Spray a baking sheet with oil.
- For the scones: In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, vanilla, pumpkin puree, and brown sugar. Using the tip of a sharp knife, cut along the length of the vanilla bean to split it open. Scrape half of the seeds into the bowl and whisk well; reserve the remaining seeds for the glaze.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the buttermilk mixture and stir until just moist. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead lightly four times with floured hands. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet and shape it into a 9-inch round about 3⁄4 inch thick. Using a knife, cut the dough all the way through into 12 wedges.
- Bake until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for about 10 minutes before glazing.
- For the glaze: Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining seeds from the vanilla bean and the milk. In another medium bowl add the powdered sugar. Using a spatula mix in the milk and combine well until it is mixed through and forms a thick glaze.
- Put the scones on parchment or wax paper and drizzle the vanilla glaze over the scones using a spoon. You can also dip the tops of the scones into the glaze, and then let them sit on the paper to harden.
- Serve warm. Leftovers can be stored in airtight containers for up to 2 days.
