notes:


ingredients:
- Dressing:

- 1|  stalk lemongrass
- 5|  tablespoons  lime juice  from about 2 1/2 limes
- 1.5|  tablespoons  fish sauce
- 1|  tablespoon brown sugar
- 1|  garlic clove  peeled
- 1|  teaspoon  chili garlic sauce  such as sambal oelek

- Salad:

- 4|  cup  green cabbage  thinly shredded
- cup  rotisserie chicken breast  skin and bones discarded
- 1|  medium Fuji apple  cored and chopped
- cup  snow peas  trimmed and thinly sliced
- 0.5|  small red bell pepper  cut into julienne strips
- 1|  shallot  thinly sliced
- 0.25|  cup  fresh mint leaves  torn
- 0.25|  cup  fresh cilantro leaves  torn
- 0.25|  cup  roasted almonds  chopped

directions:
- Trim the bottom off of the lemongrass and peel away the tough outer layers. Trim off the tough top third and bottom 1/2-inch of the stalk and discard. Smack talk with a meat tenderizer or small saucepan to release the aromatic oils and make it easier to slice. Slice the lemongrass and add to a blender with the remaining dressing ingredients. Blend until smooth and set aside.
- In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, chicken, apple, snow peas, bell pepper, shallots, and herbs. Add 2/3 of the dressing and toss to combine. Mound the salad on a large serving platter. Top with the almonds. Drizzle with remaining dressing and serve immediately.

This cool, crunchy salad features finely shredded cabbage, fresh herbs and a sweet touch of apple. For a more substantial meal, add brown rice noodles or serve with brown jasmine rice.
