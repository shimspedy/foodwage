notes:

ingredients:
- Meatballs:

- 0.5| cup  chopped basil  or parsley or dill
- 0.5| medium red onion
- 0.25  cup  sun-dried tomatoes canned in oil  drained
- 1| pound lean ground turkey  or chicken
- 1| teaspoon  oregano
- 0.5| cup  panko bread crumbs
- 1| large egg
- 1|  tablespoon  crushed garlic
- 1| tablespoon canola oil
directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F.
- To make the meatballs, mix together ground meat with herbs, diced onion, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, oregano, panko, egg, crushed garlic (or minced cloves), 0.5 teaspoon kosher salt, and pepper. Start with 1/2 cup of panko and add more if the mixture looks too wet. Roll meatballs, about 1.5″ in diameter.
- Place a cooling rack into a baking sheet and keep that next to your meatball searing station.
- Heat a non-stick frying pan, saute pan or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil.
- Add meatballs to heated oil. Sear meatballs until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. Move meatballs to the cooling rack when seared. Repeat if you had to split the meatballs into more than 1 batch.
- Place meatballs in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 165°F.
