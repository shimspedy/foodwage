Crunch into wholesome vegetable goodness when you make these carrot-zucchini fritters instead of greasy ol’ hash browns. Using carrots and zucchini instead of plain potato ups the fiber while lowering the calories. Serve with a side of plain Greek yogurt for dipping, or use these fritters as a vegetarian-friendly burger patty.
