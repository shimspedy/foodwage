This easy cobbler is a great way to use up any fresh, in-season blueberries you have but frozen blueberries are also a perfectly fine option. It’s very low in added sugar for a dessert — with most sweetness coming from the antioxidant-rich blueberries — yet it’s just sweet enough, clocking in around 200 calories and providing healthy fiber from oats and whole-wheat flour, as well as the blueberries.
