If you’ve ever enjoyed a comforting plate of pancakes, only to be overcome with guilt and feel like you want to take a nap afterward, we’ve got a solution. The healthy whole-grain and seed pancakes that follow are packed with energy foods and protein, so you’ll have the chutzpah to hike a bit more and keep the weekend warrior within you satisfied with a clean-burning breakfast.
Here’s how these flapjacks differ from your usual stack:
Whole Grains:
When we consume whole-grain flours, we enjoy every nutrient encapsulated in the grain. Bleached and processed flours that are stripped of their bran and germ don’t contain these nutrients. The recipe below calls for two of the most common whole-grain flours around; spelt and whole wheat. You could swap these for just about any flour you find in the bulk aisle — oat flour, quinoa, einkorn or buckwheat to name a few.
Flaxseed:
Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, flaxseed is a great protein source. Since our bodies digest proteins a bit more slowly than carbohydrates, protein helps keep us full longer.
Chia:
Chia naturally helps our bodies stay hydrated during activity, contains more slow-burning protein and helps our digestive systems detoxify.
Low-sugar:
You’ll note that this recipe has little sugar. The amount of maple syrup you use is up to you but know that this is where a majority of the calories in your stack come from. Use sparingly and choose fresh fruit to sweeten your pancakes instead.
The recipe below is a great jumping off point to start playing with whole-grain flapjacks, and it travels easily (so it’s suitable even for campsites!)
