ingredients:
- Muffins:

- 1.75| cups gluten-free rolled oats
- 1| cup gluten-free all-purpose flour
- 0.33333333333| cup coconut sugar or brown sugar
- 1| tsp baking powder
- 1| tsp pumpkin pie spice
- 0.5| tsp sea salt
- 1| cup mashed ripe banana from 2 large bananas
- 0.66666666666| cup 2% milk
- 0.25| cup olive oil
- 1| large egg beaten
- 1.5| teaspoons vanilla extract
- 0.25| cup chopped dark chocolate 70% cocoa solids, approx 1.5 squares
- 0.25| cup chopped walnuts

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Coat a 12-well muffin pan with cooking spray and set aside. In a food processor, pulse the oats, flour blend, sugar, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice and salt to combine, about five 1-second pulses.
- In a medium bowl, whisk the banana, milk, oil, egg and vanilla until mostly smooth. Add to the food processor and pulse a few times, just to combine. Add the nuts and chocolate and pulse a few times to disperse them evenly. Use an ice cream scoop to fill the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the largest muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Immediately transfer to a wire rack and let cool.

These muffins are like a portable bowl of oatmeal — they’re filling thanks to the oats and nuts, just a little sweet with a touch of coconut sugar and ripe banana and full of antioxidants from nuts and dark chocolate chunks. With only 5 grams of added sugar per muffin, these are great when you’re craving something sweet but want to stay within your daily recommended added sugar intake (25g for women, 37g for men).
Leftover muffins can be frozen. Defrost overnight in refrigerator and then reheat in the oven for 10 minutes at 400°F (200°C).
