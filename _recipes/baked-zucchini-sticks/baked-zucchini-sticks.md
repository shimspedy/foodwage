time: under 40 mins
servings: 4

notes:
- For best results, bread the zucchini in two batches so the crumbs don’t clump up. Divide the bread crumbs in half. Bread the first two zucchinis, then dump the crumbs and use the remaining crumbs to finish breading the last two.

The only complaint you can expect to hear about these baked zucchini sticks from The Skinnytaste Cookbook is that you didn’t make enough. Zucchinis are very low in calories and provide high levels of antioxidants in addition to being a good source of potassium, vitamin A and vitamin C.
