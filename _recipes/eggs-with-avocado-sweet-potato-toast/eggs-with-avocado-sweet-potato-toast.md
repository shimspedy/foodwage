A low-carb, high-fiber twist on traditional toast, sweet potato toast is made by thinly slicing sweet potato and toasting it in the oven (or popping in the toaster). With nearly 1/3 of your daily quota of fiber and healthy polyunsaturated fats from mashed avocado, this toast from The Honour System is well-suited to serve as a hearty breakfast or a light dinner.
