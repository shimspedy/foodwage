ingredients:
- Grilled Carrot Flatbread with Ricotta and Herbs:

- 2|  cup  ricotta
- 0.25|  cup  heavy cream
- Kosher salt and ground pepper
- 3|  tablespoons olive oil  divided, plus more for brushing and grilling
- 1|  small onion  thinly sliced
- 4|  large carrots scrubbed, and thinly sliced into coins
- packaged pizza dough
- 0.25|  cup  coarsely chopped fresh chives
- 2|  tablespoons  small dill sprigs and fresh herbs  optional

directions:
- Bring the pizza dough to room temperature. Follow package directions.
- Warm your grill. (You want it nice and hot!)
- Whisk ricotta and cream in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
- Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until soft and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add carrots and cook, tossing occasionally, 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper and set aside.
- Cut the pizza dough into 4 equal pieces and make 4 small circles by rolling out and gently stretching the dough on a floured surface. Transfer to a baking sheet and transport to grill. Take the ricotta and reserved carrots and onions with you.
- Brush one side of each flatbread with olive oil, then transfer to the grill, olive oil side down. Grill 2–3 minutes just until just charred, and in the meantime, brush the top side with olive oil.
- Using a metal spatula, flip the flatbreads so the un-grilled side is down. Grill 2–3 minutes until slightly charred. In the meantime, spread each flatbread with the ricotta mixture leaving a 1-inch border around each (you may not use all of the ricotta depending on how large or small your dough circles are.) Top with the reserved carrots and onions. Then close the lid of the grill to allow to flatbreads to finish cooking.
- Once the second side is charred to your liking, transfer the flatbreads back to the sheet pan. Sprinkle with chopped herbs. Serve immediately with a drizzle of olive oil. Makes 4 flatbreads.
