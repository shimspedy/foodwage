time: under 30 mins
servings: 4

notes:

ingredients:
- Hash:

- 1| cup  cubed Potatoes
- 1| tablespoon Olive Oil
- 0.5| small Onion  chopped (approx. 1/4 cup)
- 0.66| cup Red Pepper  thinly sliced
- 2| teaspoons Garlic  minced
- 2|  links  Chicken Sausage  (approx. 70 grams each), (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 0.125| teaspoon Black Pepper
- 0.5| cup reduced-fat shredded Cheddar Cheese
- 4| large Eggs

- Garnish:

- 1| tablespoon Buffalo Wing Sauce  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 1| stalk Green Onion  sliced
directions:
- Heat your oven to 400°F.
- Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and cook the cubed potatoes until they are just fork tender, about 3-4 minutes. Drain and set aside.
- In a large pan, heat the olive oil up on medium heat. Cook the potatoes, onion and red pepper until lightly golden and soft, about 4-5 minutes.
- Add in the garlic, chicken sausage and salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the sausage is lightly browned. Let sit for 5 minutes to caramelize the bottom.
- Sprinkle the grated cheese on and stir to mix it into the potato mixture.
- Make four wells in the hash and gently crack the eggs into them. Bake until the eggs are cooked as much as you like them-–runny eggs will take about 4-5 minutes.
- Drizzle with buffalo sauce, sprinkle with diced green onion and serve.
