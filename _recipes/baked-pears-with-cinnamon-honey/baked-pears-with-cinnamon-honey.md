ingredients:
- Pears:

- 3| medium pears
- 3| tablespoons honey
- 2| tablespoons  butter (vegan if desired)
- 0.5| teaspoon cinnamon
- 0.25| teaspoon vanilla extract

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF.
- Peel the pears with a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. Cut the ends off, then cut the pears in half. With a spoon, gently scoop out the core and seeds using a circular motion. Place the pears face down in a 9×13-inch glass dish or large baking sheet.
- In a small saucepan, combine the honey, butter, cinnamon and vanilla. Warm the sauce over low-medium heat, stirring until the butter is melted and ingredients are combined. Carefully spoon the sauce over the pears, reserving some of the sauce for later.
- Bake the pears for 30–35 minutes, until slightly soft and beginning to brown. Remove from the oven and let sit for about 5 minutes before serving. Spoon a small amount of the leftover sauce over the pears when serving.
