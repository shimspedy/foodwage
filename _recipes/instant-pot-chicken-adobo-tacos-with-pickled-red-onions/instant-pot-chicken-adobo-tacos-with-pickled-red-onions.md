notes:

ingredients:
- For the pickled onions:

- 3|  tablespoon  white wine vinegar
- 1.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 1.5|  teaspoon  sugar
- 1.4|  teaspoon  pickling spice
- 0.5|  medium  red onion  thinly sliced

- For the taco filling:

- 1.5|  pound  chicken thighs  fat trimmed
- 1|  cup  refrigerated tomato salsa  fresh
- 0.25|  cup  low-sodium chicken broth
- 1|  chipotle pepper in adobo  chopped
- 1|  teaspoon  cumin
- 1|  tablespoon  cornstarch
- 8|  corn tortillas  warmed
- 2|  cup  red cabbage or coleslaw mix  finely shredded

directions:
- For the pickled onions
- In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of water with the vinegar, salt, sugar and pickling spice. Bring to a boil over high heat. Place the onions in a medium non-reactive container and pour the pickling solution over the top. Let stand at room temperature while preparing the taco filling.
- For the taco filling - In the Instant Pot or electric pressure cooker, combine the chicken thighs, salsa, broth, chipotle pepper and cumin. Lock on the lid, select the pressure cook function and adjust to high. Make sure the steam valve is in the “sealing” position and the “keep warm” button is off. Cook for 8 minutes.
- For the taco filling - When the cooking time is up, quick-release the pressure. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and chop. Select sauté and adjust heat to high. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water and add it to the pot. Simmer until thick and bubbly, 1 minute. Pour over the chicken.
- For the taco filling - Drain the pickled onions and discard the whole spices. Serve the tortillas filled with the chicken and topped with cabbage and pickled onions.
- For the taco filling - Pro tip: To warm flour tortillas, wrap them in moist paper towels and microwave for 30–45 seconds; they’ll become warm and pliable in the moist heat. Alternatively, wrap the tortillas first in moist paper towels and then in foil. Heat in a 350°F oven until warm, 15 minutes.

A big step up from take-out, these chicken tacos take just 8 minutes to cook in the Instant Pot or electric pressure cooker. Quick-pickled onions and shredded cabbage add crunch and color without lots of extra calories.
