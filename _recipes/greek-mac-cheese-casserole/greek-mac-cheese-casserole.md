ingredients:
- Greek Mac & Cheese Casserole:

- large elbow macaroni or other hollow pasta
- spinach
- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 0.5|  onion  finely chopped
- 8|  sprigs parsley (leaves)  chopped
- 6|  sprigs dill  chopped
- 0.5|  teaspoon  black pepper
- 0.125|  teaspoon  nutmeg
- kasseri or provolone cheese
- feta cheese, crumbled

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F.
- Bring a large stockpot of water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to box directions, drain and set aside.
- Meanwhile, heat a pot over medium heat. Add 1/3 cup water and the spinach. Cover, reduce heat to low and cook until spinach is wilted and tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold, running water to cool. Use your hands to squeeze as much liquid out of the spinach as possible; working in small handfuls. Fluff the spinach back up a bit, place in a large bowl and set aside.
- Return the pot to medium-high heat, add the oil, onions, scallions and salt. Cook, stirring, until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add to the spinach. Toss in the parsley and dill. Stir everything together. Add the pepper and nutmeg; stir to combine.
- Add 3/4 of the cheeses. Stir to mix. Add the pasta; stir to combine.
- Coat an 8-by-8 baking dish with cooking spray. Dump the mixture into the dish, top with the remaining cheese and bake until browned and bubbling about 30 minutes.
- Let sit about 5 minutes before cutting into 4 pieces. Serve warm.

Feta cheese, along with tons of spinach and scads of herbs, means this green-packed version of mac and cheese has plenty of flavor without a heavy cream sauce. You can prep it to the point of baking up to 2 days ahead; keep it covered and chilled and pop it in the oven just before you’re ready to eat.
