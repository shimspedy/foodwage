notes:
- If you’re going to be short on time when making this recipe, spare yourself a few minutes by roasting the sweet potatoes a day or two in advance. Simply reheat while you poach the eggs and add the remaining toppings.

ingredients:
- Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Poached Eggs & Bell Pepper Salsa:
- 2|  sweet potatoes  about 270 grams each
- 2|  teaspoon  olive oil  divided
- 1|  small clove garlic  minced
- 1|  tablespoon  white onion  minced
- 0.33333333333|  cup  bell pepper  diced
- 0.33333333333|  cup  cherry tomatoes  diced
- 1|  tablespoon  parsley  freshly minced plus more for garnish
- 0.125|  teaspoon  black pepper
- 0.125|  teaspoon  paprika
- Pinch of sea salt
- 1|  cup  baby kale leaves
- 2|  egg
- Hot sauce or Sriracha  to serve (optional)

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C) and line a baking sheet with foil or parchment.
- Scrub the sweet potatoes and prick them a few times with a fork. Lay them on the parchment and bake for 45–60 minutes or until the flesh in the middle is soft enough to cut. Cool for about 5 minutes. Using a knife, slice them lengthwise (like a book — not all the way through) and gently pull the skin apart. Set each one on a plate.
- Meanwhile, prepare the veggies - Chop the garlic, onion, bell pepper, tomatoes and parsley. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a frying pan for 1 minute. Add the vegetable mixture along with the black pepper, paprika and sea salt. Sauté it all for 2–3 minutes or until fragrant. Transfer the vegetables to a small serving bowl.
- Poach the eggs- Fill a small saucepan about 2/3 full of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and let the water calm to a simmer. Add 1 tablespoon white vinegar, then an egg. (Pro tip- Put the egg into a measuring cup so you can gently slip it in rather than drop it.) Stir in a circular motion to keep the egg from sticking to the bottom. After 4 minutes, remove the egg with a slotted spoon and pat dry. Repeat with the other egg.
- Dress the greens- Toss the kale in the remaining olive oil.
- Arrange the baby kale on top of each sweet potato, followed by some of the sautéed veggie mixture. Top with the poached eggs and garnish with black pepper, fresh parsley and hot sauce, if desired.
