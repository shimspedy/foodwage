Bring your grill out of winter hibernation by making this grilled salmon with sweet and sour pineapple salsa courtesy of Eat Spin Run Repeat. Salmon, fresh or frozen, is a great source of heart-healthy omega-3 fats and protein. Fresh pineapple is excellent in the accompanying salsa, but you can purchase canned pineapple (in water), and use the leftover juice to marinate the salmon.
