directions:
- Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, and then add pork chops to heated oil. Sear on both sides for 3 minutes. Lower heat to medium, cover with foil, and cook for another 1 to 3 minutes, until pork reaches 145 degrees. Remove and set aside.
- Return skillet that you cooked the pork in to medium heat. Add in remaining tablespoon of cooking oil and then red onions to heated oil with a sprinkle of salt. Saute until they’re super soft or about 10 minutes. If the pan ever looks dry and the onions look like they might burn, add in a splash of water.

- Serve over pork chops and alongside orzo, quinoa, or the grain of your choice.

Lean pork chops make a great main especially when it’s seared and served with caramelized red onions. As Cook Smarts explains, searing the pork chops seals in the juices while adding balsamic vinegar creates robust flavor.
