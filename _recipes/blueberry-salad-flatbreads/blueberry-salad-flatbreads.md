ingredients:
- Blueberry Salad Flatbreads:

- 2|  balls pizza dough  14.1 ounce package
- 1|  cup  shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2|  cups  mixed baby greens
- 0.5|  cup  frozen blueberries  thawed
- 1|  tablespoon  red onion  thinly sliced
- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
- 1|  teaspoon  honey
- 0.125|  teaspoon  kosher salt
- 0.0625|  teaspoon  black pepper
- 0.5|  teaspoon  lemon zest

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425°F.
- On a lightly floured surface, roll each dough piece into an oblong shape about 11-inches long. Arrange each piece of dough on a baking sheet and poke with a fork. Bake 8 minutes or until just beginning to cook through.
- Remove from oven and top each piece with 1/2 cup shredded cheese. Place flatbreads directly on oven rack, cheese sides up, and cook until cheese is melted and slightly golden and flatbread is crispy, 8–10 minutes.
- In a bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, honey, kosher salt, and black pepper. Add mixed baby greens, blueberries, and red onion and toss until lightly coated.
- Arrange salad mixture on flatbreads, dividing evenly and sprinkle with lemon zest. Cut and serve.
