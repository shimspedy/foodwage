ingredients:
- Farro and Spinach Breakfast Salad:

- 0.5|  cup  farro
- 0.5|  cup  fat-free Greek Yogurt
- 1|  large  navel orange  zested, peeled and sectioned
- 2|  tsp  honey
- 2|  cup  baby spinach  coarsely chopped
- 1|  cup  fresh blueberries
directions:

- In a medium bowl, stir the yogurt, orange zest and honey. Cut the orange sections into bite-sized pieces, if desired.
- In a 4-cup storage container, combine the farro and the yogurt mixture and stir well to mix. Add the orange sections, spinach and blueberries and stir to combine.
- Makes about 4 cups

Make this hearty, low-sugar breakfast salad the night before, and you will be set up with an instant breakfast that’s much more exciting than a bowl of cereal. Farro has a nutty flavor, a slightly crunchy bite and works perfectly with juicy oranges and blueberries. At less than 300 calories, with 8 grams of fiber and 17 grams of protein, this is a great way to kick off a great day.
