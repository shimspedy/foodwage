ingredients:
- Paleo Coconut Flour Cookies with Collagen:

- 1|  stick  unsalted butter  softened to room temperature
- 0.25|  cup  maple syrup
- 1|  tablespoon  collagen gelatin  plus 1 tablespoon warm water
- 1|  teaspoon  vanilla
- 0.75|  cup  coconut flour
- 2|  teaspoon  baking powder
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350ºF/190ºC. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and reserve. Bring about 0.5 cup (120 mL) water to a boil in a small pot or kettle, you’ll need 2 tablespoons.
- Beat butter until creamy In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a large bowl using an electric hand mixer. Beat in the maple syrup, starting on low speed and increasing to high, scraping down and repeating as needed to mix well.
- In a heat-safe bowl, pour 1 tablespoon of warm (not boiling) water over the collagen gelatin, and stir to mix. Pour 2 tablespoons of the boiling water over the gelatin mixture. It may form a clump, just keep stirring and mashing until it dissolves in the boiling water. Stir vigorously until smooth.
- With the mixer running, drizzle the gelatin into the bottom of the mixer bowl, beating it into the butter mixture. Beat for a few seconds, until creamy. Add the vanilla and beat.
- In another bowl, stir the coconut flour, baking powder and salt, then add to the butter mixture and beat until incorporated.
- Use a tablespoon to make level portions of dough, roll each one between your palms to make a ball, then place back on the prepared baking pan. Use your palms to flatten the dough balls to 0.5-inch (1-cm) thick cookies. If the edges crack, press them back together with your fingertips.
- Bake for 10-12 minutes. The cookies will be puffed and lightly golden, but will not change color that much. When pressed they will feel soft, but become firm as they cool.
- Cool completely on a rack, then store, tightly covered, for up to 4 days

Coconut flour is a high-fiber, gluten-free flour made from coconut. It’s actually a byproduct of the coconut milk process, in which shredded coconut is soaked and pressed to extract the milk and oil, leaving the pulp behind. The pulp is dried and ground to make a light, sweet-tasting flour that is perfect for gluten-free baking. In this recipe, collagen gelatin is used to replace the egg and adds protein. Pure maple syrup and vanilla give the cookies plenty of sweetness and not too many carbs.
