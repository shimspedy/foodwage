ingredients:
- Slow Cooker Chicken & Sausage Gumbo:

- 0.5|  cup  all-purpose flour
- 12|  ounces  lower-sodium smoked Andouille chicken sausage
- 2|  boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces  5 ounces or 140 grams
- 1|  large  onion, chopped
- 1|  large  green bell pepper, chopped
- 2|  medium  celery stalks, minced
- 2|  cup  sliced fresh or frozen okra  unthawed
- 3|  garlic cloves, minced
- 1|  can  can diced tomatoes, undrained  14.5-ounce or 410-gram
- 2|  teaspon  Creole seasoning
- 1|  teaspoon  dried thyme
- 2|  cup  reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 2|  cup  shredded chard or kale, or torn spinach
- 3|  cups  hot cooked rice
- 3|  medium  green onion stalks, sliced

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Sprinkle flour on a heavy sheet pan or in a cast-iron skillet; bake, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven; cool to room temperature.
- DID YOU KNOW? Roux is the secret ingredient to many Louisiana specialties. This fat-flour mixture serves as a thickener and adds a rich nutty flavor. The secret to shaving off calories is a fat-free roux. Instead of cooking equal parts fat and flour on the stove, all-purpose flour is baked in the oven to a golden brown color without oil or butter.
- Meanwhile, cook sausage slices and chicken in a nonstick skillet over medium heat for 3–4 minutes until lightly browned. (This step is optional, but searing the meat gives the gumbo more flavor.) Place sausage, chicken, onion, bell pepper, celery, okra, garlic, tomatoes, seasoning and thyme in a 6-quart slow cooker.
- In a medium bowl or 4-cup measuring cup, whisk together broth and reserved browned flour until smooth. Pour into slow cooker; stir until blended. Cover, and cook on low for 8–10 hours or high for 6 hours.
- Stir in greens; cover and cook on low for 15 minutes until greens wilt.
- Serve gumbo over 1/2 cup cooked rice. Sprinkle each serving evenly with green onions.

This hearty soup is perfect for chilly fall evenings or an afternoon tailgate party. Our version is veggie heavy with Southern favorites like fiber-rich okra and greens but works just fine if you skip the okra. You can find cut okra in the frozen food section, and since this cooks for many hours, you don’t have to thaw it before putting in the slow cooker.
