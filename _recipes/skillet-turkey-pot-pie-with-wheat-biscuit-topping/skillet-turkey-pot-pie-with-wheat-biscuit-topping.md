- In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda and salt. Add the butter and cut it into the flour mixture with a fork or your fingertips until the butter is in tiny flecks no larger than a lentil.
- Add the buttermilk and stir until the mixture comes together; do not over-mix.
- Divide the dough into 8 portions (a scant 0.25 cup each) and gently form them into rough, 0.5-inch thick disks. Arrange the biscuits evenly on top of the chicken mixture.
- Bake until the biscuits are golden brown, 25 minutes.

This one-pan pot pie is stuffed with lean turkey breast and veggies, then topped with whole-wheat biscuits for a lightened update on the comfort food classic. Don’t over-handle the biscuits or they will become tough; rustic is the goal here.
