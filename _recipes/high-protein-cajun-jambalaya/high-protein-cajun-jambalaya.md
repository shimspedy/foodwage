- Prepare 2 foil pouches. Coat each piece of foil with cooking spray. Divide mixture evenly among both pieces of foil and seal.
- Place pouches on a baking sheet and position on the middle oven rack, baking 25 minutes or until rice and proteins are fully cooked. *When done, rice will be soft and proteins will be firm and opaque* To test for doneness, carefully open one pouch and taste a few grains of rice from the center of the pouch. If necessary, close pouch and return to oven for 5 more minutes.
- Carefully open the pouch and pour the mixture into a large serving bowl; enjoy immediately.
