With only five ingredients, this tender pot roast from The Roasted Root requires only 10 minutes of active prep. After that, the slow cooker works its magic. Beyond convenience, slow cooking increases the bioavailability of your meat, so you’ll maximize the pork’s excellent source of thiamin, zinc, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, niacin, phosphorus and iron.
