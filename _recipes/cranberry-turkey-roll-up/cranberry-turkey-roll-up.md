ingredients:
- Cranberry Turkey Roll-Up:

- 4|  100% whole-grain tortillas about 190 calories each
- 0.5|  cup  canned whole-berry cranberry sauce
- 12|  thin slices  deli turkey breast  12 ounces or 340 grams
- 2|  medium  tomatoes, halved and sliced
- 12|  small  lettuce leaves, washed
- 4|  slice  Swiss cheese, halved  4 ounces or 115 grams

directions:
- Layout 1 tortilla on a large plate, and microwave for 10–20 seconds. This will soften it, making it easier for you to roll.
- Spread 2 tablespoons cranberry sauce in the center of the tortilla wrap. Layer turkey slices, tomatoes, lettuce leaves and cheese on the wrap. Leave 1–2 inches on the sides of the tortilla.
- To create your roll-up, fold in the sides of your tortilla, then tightly roll toward the top.
- Top with deli sliced turkey, sliced tomatoes, lettuce leaves and cheese. Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll tightly toward the top. Repeat to create 3 more rolls. Wrap each roll in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.
- When you’re ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and slice into 4–6 roll-ups.

Cranberry turkey roll-ups are as colorful as they are convenient. Just roll up lean sliced turkey breast with crisp veggies and cheese. The secret kick is in the sweet cranberry sauce, which you can buy at the store or make at home.
