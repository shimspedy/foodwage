ingredients:
- Salad:

- 0.5|  pound  fingerling potatoes  To Taste
- 2|  Large Eggs  0.5|
- 3|  cup  Lightly Packed Watercress  1|
- 0.25|  cup  Loosely Packed Sliced Red Onion  4|

- Garnish:

- To Taste  Dill Sprigs To Taste

- Vinaigrette:

- 0.25|  cup  White Wine Vinegar  2|
- 2|  tsp  whole-grain mustard  1|
- 0.25|  cup  olive oil  0.25|
- 2  tbsp  chopped dil  To Taste

directions:
- Place potatoes in a medium pot and cover with water. Season with salt. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, about 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to a work surface and let cool slightly. Return the water to a gentle boil.
- Fill a medium bowl with ice water. Using a slotted spoon, gently lower the eggs into the boiling water and cook over moderately-high heat for 6.5 minutes. Drain the eggs and transfer to the ice bath. Let cool slightly, then pat dry and peel. You want the whites of the egg to be set and the yolk to be jammy and slightly runny. To make peeling easier, use eggs that have been in your fridge for a week or two and peel them while they’re still a little warm.
- In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar with the mustard and agave. While whisking constantly, slowly stream in both oils. Stir in the chopped dill and season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper. This recipe makes more vinaigrette than you’ll need, so save it for other salads.
- Using a sharp knife, cut the fingerling potatoes in half lengthwise. Cut the soft-boiled eggs in half lengthwise, being careful not to spill the yolk.
- Smear the Greek yogurt on the bottom of two salad plates. Arrange the watercress, cucumber, red onion, potatoes and salmon on each plate. Carefully place two soft-boiled egg halves on each plate. Drizzle each salad with 2 tablespoons of the mustard-dill vinaigrette (note: the recipe makes 0.75 cup of vinaigrette total). Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper; garnish with dill sprigs. Serve right away.
- Make ahead: The potatoes, soft-boiled eggs and vinaigrette can be refrigerated overnight. Bring to room temperature before assembling the salads.

Who knew salad for breakfast could be so satisfying? Move over bagels and lox because this salad is going to take some serious breakfast table real estate. The buttery potatoes coupled with the smoked salmon and dill are reminiscent of a (healthier) deconstructed potato pancake. This recipe makes more vinaigrette than you’ll need, so save the leftovers for future salads, drizzling over roasted vegetables or as a marinade for chicken.
