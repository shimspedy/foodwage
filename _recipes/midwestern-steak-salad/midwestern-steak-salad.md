notes:


ingredients:
- For the Marinated Steak:

- 1|  pound  flatiron steak
- 2|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  medium  lemon, juiced
- 1|  medium  lime, juiced
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  pepper
- 0.25|  teaspoon  cumin
- 0.25|  teaspoon  paprika
- Dash of cayenne pepper

- For the Avocado Cilantro Dressing:

- 0.33333333333|  cup  non-fat greek yogurt  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 2|  medium  avocados, pit and peel removed
- 0.5|  large  bunch of fresh cilantro
- 1|  lime, juiced
- 1|  teaspoon  salt
- 1|  cup  water

- For the Salad:

- 8  cup  packed mixed greens
- 2  cup  slice cherry tomatoes
- 1  cup  grated cotija cheese  or cheese of choice
- 1  can of black beans, drained and rinsed  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 1  can of sweet corn, drained and rinsed  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 1  jalapeño, thinly sliced

directions:
-  Place steak in a large zip lock bag (or in a large bowl).
- Whisk all the remaining marinade ingredients together and pour over the meat. Seal the bag (or cover the bowl with saran wrap), removing any extra air, and place in the fridge overnight, or for at least 6 hours.
- Remove meat from the bag/bowl and sauté (or grill) over medium heat with a little bit of olive oil until it reaches your desired doneness. I cooked the meat on the stove for about 5 minutes on each side, covered. Let meat sit on a cutting board for about five minutes before you slice it into 1/4 inch thick slices.
- Place all dressing ingredients in a food processor or blender and blend, adding the water slowly, until completely smooth. You want the dressing to be the consistency of ranch dressing.
- Once the meat has cooled to room temperature, add all salad ingredients to a large bowl and pour about 2 tablespoons of dressing per person (8 tablespoons total) on top. Toss to combine and serve immediately.
