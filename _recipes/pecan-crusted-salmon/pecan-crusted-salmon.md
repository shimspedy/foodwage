meal: lunch dinner
chef: foodwage
time: under 15 mins
servings: 4

notes:
- To remove the scales from the salmon skin, hold the salmon under cold running water and gently run a spoon or the blunt side of a knife over the skin until all scales are off.

ingredients:
- Salmon:

- 4| fillets  wild salmon
- 0.5| cup toasted pecans  very finely chopped
- 0.5| cup  panko  (substitute with regular breadcrumbs, in a pinch)
- 0.25| cup olive oil  no need to be exact but roughly this amount works great
- 1| tablespoon finely chopped parsley
- 1| tablespoon butter
- 1| large pinch  salt
- pepper  Optional

directions:
- Melt butter in a medium skillet. Add pecans, panko, parsley and salt and stir to combine. Set aside.
- Wash the salmon and remove scales from the skin. Make 3 small cuts across the skin side to prevent the skin from shrinking when it cooks. Dry salmon thoroughly. Season the skin with salt and pepper.
- Working with the salmon skin side down, mound the pecan mixture evenly across each piece. Drizzle olive oil over the pecan mixture on the salmon and press firmly on the mixture so that it has good contact with the salmon.
- Heat a splash of olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the salmon, pecan crust side down. Cook for 2 minutes or until the pecan crust has browned.
- Flip the salmon over and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, or until it light pink and flakes easily. Be careful not to overcook the salmon or it will become tough and chewy.
