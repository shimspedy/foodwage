ingredients:
- One-Pan Mediterranean Eggs:

- 1.5|  tbsp  cooking oil
- 3|  clove  garlic,  minced
- 1|  medium  onion  diced
- 3|  jalapenos  seeds removed and diced
- 1|  can  low-sodium diced tomatoes
- 0.5|  tsp  cumin
- 0.5|  tsp  paprika
- 0.5|  tsp  chili powder
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 4|  large  eggs
- 0.25|  bunch parsley  chopped
- baby carrots
- store-bought hummus
- 1|  medium  bell pepper,  sliced
- 1|  medium  cucumber  sliced into sticks
directions:
- Heat up a skillet or saute pan that you have a lid for over medium-high heat. Add cooking oil to pan; add garlic, onions and jalapenos to heated oil with a dash of salt. Saute for about 6 minutes, until softened.
- Add in diced tomatoes with cumin, paprika, chili powder and salt. Mix everything through. Saute for about 4 minutes.
- Crack eggs directly into tomatoes. Lower heat to medium, cover, and cook for about 5 minutes, or until eggs are done to your liking.
- Garnish with parsley. Arrange your Mediterranean platter of pita, baby carrots, peppers, cucumbers and hummus. If you have leftover Greek yogurt, you can also serve that up with the eggs. Use pita to scoop up egg and hummus. The veggies can be dipped into hummus and yogurt.
- If you would like toasted pita, heat oven or toaster oven to 350 degrees F (about 177 degrees C). Toast pita for 5 to 7 minutes when oven has warmed up. Serve with the eggs

This fun Mediterranean dish by Cook Smarts is friendly for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Eggs are softly cooked in a tangy tomato sauce, and served with crisp veggies like bell peppers, baby carrots and cucumbers. Toast some pita for added crunch, or go without for a lower-carb dish.
