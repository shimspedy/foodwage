- 4| ounces  fresh Mozzarella Cheese  thinly sliced

directions:
- Place a pizza stone or heavy baking sheet in oven. Preheat oven to 450F (keep pizza stone or baking sheet in oven as it preheats).    
- Sprinkle both sides of chicken evenly with black pepper and salt. Combine brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, and ground cumin in a small bowl, stirring well to combine. Set aside 2 teaspoons spice mixture, and rub the remaining spice mixture evenly over all sides of chicken. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add chicken to pan; sauté 3 minutes on each side or until chicken is done. Let chicken stand 10 minutes, and slice thinly against the grain.    
- Roll dough into a 14 x 9-inch rectangle (or a 14-inch circle) on a lightly floured surface; pierce dough with a fork. Lightly coat dough with cooking spray. Carefully remove pizza stone from oven. Sprinkle cornmeal over pizza stone; place dough on pizza stone. Bake at 450° for 9 minutes.    
- Combine reserved 2 teaspoons spice mixture, ketchup, mustard, and vinegar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring mixture to a simmer, and cook 3 minutes or until slightly thick, stirring occasionally. Remove partially cooked crust from oven; spread ketchup mixture evenly over crust, leaving a 0.5-inch border around the edges. Top with chicken, onion, jalapeños, and cheese.    
- Bake at 450F for 10 minutes or until cheese is browned. Sprinkle with cilantro. Slice.

Nothing is fresher than fresh baked pizza when it comes piping hot out of your own oven. This weekend-worthy pizza from Cooking Light is packed with flavor as well as protein. Pair it with a whole wheat pizza crust (optional) and you have a high fiber meal option. Milky fresh mozzarella helps tame the bites of tangy pepper in this recipe. Skip the red onion and jalapenos for a kid friendly family meal.
