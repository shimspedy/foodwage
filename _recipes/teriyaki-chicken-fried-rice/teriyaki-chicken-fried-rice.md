ingredients:
- Teriyaki Chicken Fried “Rice”:

- 1|  medium cauliflower head  rinsed or 4 cups “riced” cauliflower
- 1|  tablespoon  canola oil
- 1|  tablespoon  sesame oil
- 3|  eggs  beaten
- onion  finely diced
- 1|  cup  frozen peas and carrots
- 2|  cloves garlic,  minced
- 1|  ohnsonville® Teriyaki Glazed Flame Grilled Chicken Breasts  cut into 1/4-inch chunks, juices reserved
- 3|  tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce
- 3|  scallions sliced  whites and greens separated
- Sesame seeds optional garnish

directions:
- To prep the cauliflower, remove the core and chop coarsely into florets. Place half of the cauliflower in a food processor and pulse until the it reaches the consistency of fine rice or couscous, being careful not to over process. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with remaining cauliflower.
- Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the eggs and cook 2–3 minutes or until firm, stirring occasionally. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
- Heat the sesame oil in the skillet. Add diced onion, scallion whites, peas and carrots and garlic and sauté for 3–4 minutes. Add the cauliflower rice along with the teriyaki sauce. Mix and cook approximately 4–5 minutes, stirring frequently, just until the cauliflower is tender and warmed through. Add chopped chicken and juices and cook for an additional 2–3 minutes.
- Mix in the cooked egg, scallion greens and remove from heat. Portion and top with a sprinkle of sesame seeds, if using.
