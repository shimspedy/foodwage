notes:

ingredients:
- Wrap:

- 1|  Whole-Wheat Tortilla  approx. 100 calories, no added sugar
- 1|  tablespoon  all-natural Peanut Butter
- 0.33|  medium Banana  diced
- 2|  tablespoons  Blueberries
- 2|  eggs
- 1|  tsp  Cinnamon
- 0.5| tsp  Vanilla extract
- Strawberries, diced  Other optional filling ingredients
- Maple Syrup  Other optional filling ingredients
- Nut Butter  Other optional filling ingredients
- Shredded Coconut  Other optional filling ingredients
directions:
- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and prepare it with an all-natural cooking spray or coconut oil.
- Whisk eggs, cinnamon and vanilla together in a shallow bowl. Dip wrap in shallow bowl, making sure to cover the entire wrap with the egg mixture. There will be leftover egg mixture.
- Lay the wrap flat on the skillet and cook for about 2-4 minutes on each side.
- Transfer wrap to a plate and use the same heated skillet (you may need more cooking spray or oil) to cook up the leftover egg mixture, omelet style. Cooking your egg omelet or pancake style makes the egg easier to transfer to your wrap and it also will stay put in the wrap better.
- Add in your favorite filling ingredient like diced bananas, blueberries and peanut butter.
- Roll up your Cinnamon French Toast Wrap and cut in half, if desired. You can add a drizzle of maple syrup and a sprinkle of shredded unsweetened coconut over the top.
