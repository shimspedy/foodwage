ingredients:
- Omelet:

- 5  Egg Whites
- 2  teaspoons  chopped fresh Parsley
- 0.125  teaspoon  Herbes de Provence  crushed
- 1  cup  Baby Spinach
- 1  ounce  Smoked Salmon  thinly sliced
- 2  tablespoons  crumbled Goat Cheese  1 ounce
- 1  slice  Whole Wheat Bread  toasted
- 1  Orange  sectioned
directions:
- Whisk together the egg whites, parsley, and herbes de Provence in a medium bowl until blended. Set aside.
- Heat a small nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Cook the spinach in 1 tablespoon of water for 2 minutes or until wilted. Place in a bowl and set aside. Wipe the skillet clean.
- Recoat the skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Add the egg mixture and cook, without stirring, for 15 seconds. When the edges begin to set, push them into the center with a rubber spatula, allowing the uncooked portion to cook. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, continuing to the push edges into the center as they set, or until the eggs are no longer runny.
- Scatter the spinach, salmon, and goat cheese on half of the omelet. Gently fold the other half over and cook for 1 minute to melt the cheese. Slide the omelet onto a plate. Serve with the toast and orange.
