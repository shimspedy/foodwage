ingredients:
- Savory Overnight Steel-Cut Oats:

- 0.5|  cup  steel cut oats
- 1|  tsp  tamari soy sauce
- 1|  cup  cubed sweet potato
- 1|  cup  watercress leaves
- 2|  Morningstar Farms Maple Breakfast Sausages  (vegetarian) or turkey breakfast sausages
- 2|  tsp  pure maple syrup

directions:
- In a small pot, combine the steel-cut oats, water and tamari soy sauce. Place over high heat and bring to a full boil. Cover and cook for 1 minute, reducing the heat so it won’t boil over. Turn off the heat and leave the pot, covered, on the stove top overnight.
- In the morning, place the pot over high heat again and bring to a boil, then stir often for 5 minutes, until the oats are tender.
- Cube the sweet potato and place in a steamer, then steam for about 10 minutes. Prep the watercress leaves and reserve.
- Just before serving, sear the sausage patties in a nonstick pan according to package directions, about 3 minutes.

Steel-cut oats are lower on the glycemic index than rolled oats, because they are less processed. They can take a while to cook but try this easy method to start them the night before. They are a chewy, creamy base for a savory breakfast, with hearty sausage, sweet potatoes and peppery watercress — you’ll get a hint of sweetness from a drizzle of maple.
