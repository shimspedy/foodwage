notes:

ingredients:
- Cloud Bread and Lox Sandwiches:

- 2|  large eggs  separated
- neufchatel cheese,  softened and separated
- 0.25|  tsp  cream of tartar
- lox
- 4|  leaves lettuce
- 4|  teaspoon  minced red onion
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and reserve.
- Separate the eggs and put the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Add 1 ounce (2 tablespoons/30g) of the Neufchatel cheese to the egg yolks and beat with a fork until smooth. Reserve.
- In a stand mixer, using the whisk attachment, or in a bowl with an electric mixer, whisk the egg white and cream of tartar on low speed to mix, then raise the speed to high and whip to achieve firm peaks.
- Dollop about 0.25 of the beaten egg whites into the yolk mixture and fold in roughly, to lighten the mixture. Add the rest and fold in gently to keep the whites lofty.
- Scoop 0.5-cup portions of the batter and drop on the prepared pan, leaving a couple of inches in between. Spread to an even 1-inch thickness, making them as round as possible.
- Bake for 30 minutes, until golden on top and firm to the touch. Cool to room temperature before peeling off the paper.
- For sandwiches, use a serrated knife to split each cloud bread in half. Chop the lox and divide in four portions. Gently spread 0.25 (about 1.5 tablespoons) of the Neufchatel on the bottom half of each bread, then top with 1 teaspoon of Dijon and 0.25 of the lox. Sprinkle each with a teaspoon of red onion. Top with a lettuce leaf and close the sandwich. Serve immediately.

When you want to avoid carbs and still have a sandwich, make cloud bread. These eggy puffs stand in for a bagel in a bagel-and-lox style sandwich, so you can skip wheat, gluten and carbs while enjoying a classic.
