Happy Meatless Monday! Butternut squash is a powerhouse for vitamins A and C. You can pack butternut squash puree into your lasagna to give it a nutritious boost. Using no-boil noodles is another time saver, and they work best when the lasagna is saucy with plenty of moisture for the noodles to absorb. They appear puny in the pan when assembling, but they will plump up while cooking. To freeze servings for lunch, wrap portions airtight and place in plastic storage bags for 1–3 months.
