ingredients:
- Tempeh Pad Thai With Broccoli and Corn:

- dry brown rice pad Thai noodles
- 1|  tbsp  brown sugar
- 1|  tbsp  fish sauce
- 1|  tbsp  Sriracha hot sauce
- 1|  tbsp  tamarind concentrate such as Tamicon
- 1.5|  tbsp  coconut or safflower oil
- tempeh  cut into bite-size strips
- 2|  large  garlic cloves
- 2|  cup  cabbage  chopped
- 0.5|  medium  red bell pepper  thinly sliced
- 0.5|  cup  fresh corn shaved off 1 cob
- 2|  large  eggs  beaten
- 3|  green onions  thinly sliced
- 0.25|  cup  chopped cilantro
- 1|  lime  cut into quarters

directions:
- Prepare the noodles according to package instructions, erring on the side of slightly underdone (the noodles will continue to cook when stir-fried). Drain, rinse with cool water and set aside.
- In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons (30ml) hot water with the brown sugar, fish sauce, Sriracha and tamarind. Stir and set aside.
- Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a wok or large, nonstick sauté pan. Add the tempeh and stir-fry until browned in places, 2 minutes. Add the garlic and stir-fry until fragrant, 20 seconds. Add the cabbage, bell pepper and corn and stir-fry until the cabbage is wilted and tender, 2 minutes.
- Push the tempeh and vegetables to the side of the pan. Add the eggs and stir-fry until just cooked, 1 minute. Add the noodles and sauce mixture to the wok and stir-fry everything together until the noodles sear in places, 1–2 minutes. Add the green onions and toss to combine. Divide the noodles among 4 bowls and sprinkle with the cilantro. Serve with lime wedges on the side.

Tempeh adds nutty flavor and 9 grams of protein to this Thai-inspired takeout favorite. Be sure to read labels when buying fish sauce; some brands contain a lot more sodium than others; one of the lowest in sodium is Tiparos brand.
