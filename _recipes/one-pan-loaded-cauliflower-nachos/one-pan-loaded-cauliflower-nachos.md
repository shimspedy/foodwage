These are “na-cho” usual chips. This Fit Foodie Finds recipe uses roasted cauliflower as the nacho base and is topped with chicken, cheese and beans. Not only do you get an extra serving of veggies from the cauliflower, the beans also provide a healthy dose of fiber and protein. Feel free to customize these cauliflower nachos by adding your favorite toppings such as guacamole, black beans or ground beef.
