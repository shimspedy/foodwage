servings: 1

notes:


ingredients:
- Hash:

- 1|  medium slice bacon  cooked
- 6|  Brussels sprouts  thinly sliced
- 1| tablespoon olive oil
- 2| tablespoons  chopped pistachio  or other preferred variety of nut
- 1|  large egg
- to taste  Salt
- to taste  pepper
- to taste  mustard  Optional flavor additions
- to taste  red wine vinegar  Optional flavor additions
- to taste  hot sauce  Optional flavor additions

directions:
- Heat a medium-sized non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add ½ the oil and then chopped bacon. Cook bacon for about 3 to 4 minutes until the edges start to crisp.
- Add brussels sprouts and sauté for about another 2 to 3 minutes. Since the sprouts have been sliced so thinly, they will cook quite quickly. Add your flavors and nuts and toss through. Spoon your hash onto a serving plate, and return the pan over medium-high heat.
- Add another half tbs. of oil and crack your egg(s) into pan. If you’re indulging and want to fry your eggs with some butter, you’re welcome to use a combination of butter / oil (hey, if you’re having brussels sprouts for breakfast, you can indulge and no one will criticize!). Once your egg is fried, slide it over your hash and sprinkle with desired amount of salt and pepper. At this point, I like to break the yolk, and use it as a sauce for my brussels sprout breakfast hash.
