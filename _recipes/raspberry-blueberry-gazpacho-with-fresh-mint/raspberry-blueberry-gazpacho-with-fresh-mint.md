Common in Europe and usually eaten for dessert, a kissel is similar to a fruity gazpacho. With an abundance of vitamin C and 6 grams of fiber, this gazpacho from Skinnytaste is surprisingly low-calorie at just 114 calories a serving. Garnish with mint or basil and add a scoop of frozen yogurt to balance the tartness of the berries. Tip: Make the soup the night before and keep it chilled until serving time.
