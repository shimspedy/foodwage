notes:

- 
ingredients:
- Grits:

- 1| tbsp olive oil
- 1| medium onion chopped
- 2| small garlic cloves chopped
- 15| oz no sodium-added diced tomatoes 1 can
- 1| tbsp salt-free Cajun seasoning
- 2| lbs head cauliflower leaves, hard stem and core removed
- 0.75| cup milk or unsweetened non-dairy milk
- 0.5| tsp salt divided
- 0.25| tsp pepper
- 0.5| cup cheddar cheese grated
- 1| lbs shrimp peeled and deveined
- 0.25| cup parsley chopped
- Hot sauce optional, for serving

directions:
- Heat the oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the bell pepper and onions and sauté until the vegetables are tender and beginning to brown, 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, Cajun seasoning and 0.25| teaspoon of salt and bring to a simmer. Cover and reduce heat to low.
- Cut any leaves off of the cauliflower. Grate the cauliflower with a box grater into rice-like bits, stopping when you get to the hard core and stem. Discard core and place the grated cauliflower in a medium saucepan. Add the milk, remaining 0.25| teaspoon salt and a bay leaf. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the cauliflower is very tender, about 8 minutes. Season with pepper and stir in the cheese. Cover and keep warm over low heat.
- Add the shrimp to the tomato mixture, cover and cook over low heat, stirring once, until the shrimp are cooked through, about 8 minutes. Divide the “grits” among 4 shallow bowls and top with the shrimp mixture and a sprinkle of parsley.

This quick, mildly spicy Cajun-inspired shrimp dish substitutes traditional corn grits with grated cauliflower. When cooked with a little milk and bay leaves, the cauliflower becomes tender and creamy. If you keep the cauliflower head whole, it makes grating the cauliflower a breeze, just stop when you get to the hardest part of the core.
RD tip: Swapping corn grits for cauliflower increases the fiber content by 5 grams. This recipe is great if you are trying to eat a high-protein diet because you still want to make sure you’re getting enough fiber.
