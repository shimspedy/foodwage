ingredients:
- Peanut Butter Oatmeal Breakfast Cookie:

- 1|  tbsp  refined coconut oil
- 0.25|  cup  creamy  no-salt peanut butter
- 0.25|  cup  maple syrup
- 1|  large  egg white
- 0.25|  tsp  vanilla
- 0.25|  cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
- 1|  cup  rolled oats
- 0.25|  cup  protein powder
- 0.25|  cup  rotein powder
- 0.25|  tsp  baking soda

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375ºF (190ºC). Coat a cookie sheet with nonstick spray and reserve. In a large bowl, stir coconut oil, peanut butter, maple syrup, egg white and vanilla. In a small bowl, mix flour, oats, protein powder and baking soda. Stir the flour mixture into the wet mixture until well combined.
- Scoop by 2-tablespoon sized portions and roll to form balls before placing on a prepared sheet pan leaving 3 inches between them. Wet your palm under running water and use it to flatten the cookies to about 0.25 – 0.75 inches thick.
- Bake for 6 minutes on the bottom rack, then move to the top rack for 6 minutes. The tops will be golden brown, but slightly soft when pushed in the center. Cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Store the cookies in an airtight container or zip-top bag for up to a week or freeze for 2 months.
