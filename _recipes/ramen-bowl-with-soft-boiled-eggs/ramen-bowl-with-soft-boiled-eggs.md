directions:
- Place the eggs in a pot and cover with cold water. Place the pot over high heat until it comes to a boil. Once boiling, set a timer for 6 minutes. After 6 minutes, remove the eggs from the pot and place them into a bowl of ice water to prevent overcooking. Set aside.
- Place a large pot over medium heat. Add the sesame oil, ginger, garlic, mushrooms and carrots. Cook for 3–4 minutes until the mushrooms have cooked down slightly.
- Add the vegetable broth and tamari. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and add the spaghetti. Cook for about 7 minutes, until the spaghetti is al dente.
- Add the broccoli and baby bok choy, cover and cook for 3–4 minutes, until the broccoli and bok choy are tender. Turn off the heat.
- Crack the egg shells, then peel under running water to wash away any small shell pieces. Slice each egg in half.
- Ladle the soup evenly between four bowls, then top with the eggs and green onions. Garnish with sriracha and sesame seeds, if desired.

This spin on ramen uses whole wheat pasta, tamari (a wheat-free soy sauce), Eggland’s Best eggs and a number of veggies for a bold, fresh flavor that rivals any take-out ramen bowl.
