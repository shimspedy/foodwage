notes:

ingredients:
- frittata:

- 1| dozen large eggs
- 0.5| cup 2% Greek yogurt
- to taste Kosher salt
- to taste pepper
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 bunch large spring onions
- 1 bunch Lacinato kale stemmed and leaves chopped
- 0.25| tsp crushed red pepper
- 0.25| cup Parmesan cheese finely shredded and loosely packed
- 0.5| cup parsley leaves loosely packed
- 0.25| cup Parmesan cheese shaved
- 0.25| cup small dill sprigs loosely packed
- 0.25| cup mint leaves loosely packed

- Garnishes:

- to taste Olive oil for drizzling
- to taste Freshly grated lemon zest
- to taste Flaky sea salt
- to taste Lemon wedges
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 300°F (150ºC). In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the yogurt until very smooth. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
- Trim the tops of the spring onions so the bulbs can lay flat in a 10-inch, non-stick, ovenproof skillet. Slice the spring onions lengthwise. Save the tops for another use.
- In the skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Arrange the spring onions cut-side down, season lightly with salt, and cook over moderate heat without flipping until browned, 3–5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
- Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet and heat. Add the kale, crushed red pepper and season lightly with salt. Cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3 minutes. Turn the heat off.
- Pour the egg mixture over the kale, stirring to evenly distribute the greens. Arrange the spring onions cut-side up on top and sprinkle with the shredded Parmesan. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the top is golden brown and the middle is just set, about 20 minutes.
- Let the frittata cool slightly in the skillet before sliding it out onto a platter. Garnish with parsley, dill, mint and the 0.25| cup of shaved parmesan. Drizzle with more olive oil. Freshly grate some lemon zest over the top and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Slice and serve, passing lemon wedges at the table.

On top of providing tons of protein, this recipe gives you more than 100% of your daily vitamins A and C, thanks to the kale.
By cooking your frittata on a lower oven setting for a longer period of time, you get a denser, creamier texture without having to add any high-fat dairy. You can serve this spring onion frittata hot from the oven or at room temperature, but do not skip the vibrant herb salad piled on top. Any next-day leftovers are phenomenal thinly sliced and eaten on toasted multigrain bread with a drizzle of olive oil.
