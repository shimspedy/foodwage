ingredients:
- Chicken and Zucchini Enchiladas:

- 3|  cup  packed shredded chicken  from 0.5 a rotisserie chicken
- 1|  medium  zucchini  shredded and excess liquid squeezed out
- 1|  large  ear of corn shucked and kernels cut from the cob
- 1|  cup  canned low-sodium black beans,  rinsed and drained
- 0.25|  cup  chopped cilantro
- 1|  tsp  ground cumin
- 2.5|  cup  store-bought tomatillo salsa
- 1|  cup  2% Greek yogurt
- 1|  cup  crumbled cotija cheese
- 1|  cup  crumbled cotija cheese
- Kosher salt and pepper
- 10|  8-inch corn tortillas
- 2|  tbsp  fresh lime juice
- Small cilantro sprigs  Optional garnishes
- Chopped avocado  Optional garnishes
- Lime wedges  Optional garnishes
- Hot sauce  Optional garnishes

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C). In a large bowl, combine the chicken, zucchini, corn, black beans, cilantro, cumin, 1/2 cup of tomatillo salsa, 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt and 0.5 the cotija cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
- Spread 1 cup of the tomatillo salsa in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.
- Working with one tortilla at a time, spread a scant 0.5 cup of the chicken filling down the middle of a tortilla and roll it up like a cigar. Place the enchilada seam-side down in the baking dish.
- Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling. Spread the remaining 1-cup of tomatillo salsa over the top of the enchiladas and sprinkle with the remaining 0.5 cup of cotija cheese.
- Bake until bubbling and beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly. The enchilada filling can be refrigerated overnight.
- Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the remaining 0.5 cup of Greek yogurt with the 2 tablespoons lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle the lime crema over the enchiladas and garnish with cilantro and chopped avocado. Serve with lime wedges and hot sauce.

These lightened-up enchiladas are the perfect dish to make while we’re transitioning from summer to fall. The fresh corn and zucchini are still in season, but the enchiladas are hearty and satisfying enough for a chilly evening. For added protein — and to mimic the creaminess of cheese — mix low-fat Greek yogurt into the filling. This keeps the enchiladas creamy on the inside, while a small amount of cheese sprinkled over the top gives you that crispy, browned top you love. Also note: Rotisserie chicken can be high in sodium, so boiling chicken breasts to shred could be a less convenient, but healthier, alternative.
