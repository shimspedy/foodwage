We lighten up this fall favorite by holding back on the sugar and topping it with toasted oats and pecans instead of sugary marshmallows. Pecans are loaded with healthy unsaturated fat and more than 19 vitamins and minerals including vitamin B and E, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc! Whether you’re looking for a healthy side or dessert, our simple sweet potato casserole fits the bill.
