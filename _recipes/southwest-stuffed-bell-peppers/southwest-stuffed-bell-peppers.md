ingredients:
- Southwest Stuffed Bell Peppers:

- 3|  teaspoon  olive oil
- 0.5|  medium  yellow onion  finely chopped
- 1|  Anaheim pepper  cored and chopped
- 3|  cloves garlic  minced
- 0.5|  teaspoon  chili powder
- 0.5|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 2|  cup  cooked rice  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 1|  cup  corn  drained and rinsed (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 1|  cup  black beans  drained and rinsed (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 1|  can  enchilada sauce  divided (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 4| medium  bell peppers (any color)  cored and seeds removed
- 0.25|  cup  water
- 0.5|  cup  shredded mozzarella cheese

directions:
- Preheat to 350°F.
- Add the olive oil to a large skillet, and heat to medium high. Add the onion, and sauté 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add Anaheim pepper, and sauté another 2–3 minutes. Add garlic, chili powder and salt, and sauté until garlic is fragrant, about 2–3 minutes.
- Add 1/2 cup enchilada sauce, rice, corn and black beans. Stir well and cook just until rice has absorbed most of the enchilada sauce, about 1– 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
- Stuff each pepper with the rice and vegetable mixture, filling each cavity to the top. Top each pepper with grated cheese, and place peppers in an 8-by-8-inch baking dish. The peppers should fit snugly in the baking dish and should hold one another up.
- Pour remaining enchilada sauce and the water around the peppers so they’re sitting in a sauce bath. Place on the center rack of the oven, and bake for 30–40 minutes, until cheese has melted and the tops of the peppers have softened.
- Remove peppers from the oven, and allow them to cool for 10 minutes before serving.
