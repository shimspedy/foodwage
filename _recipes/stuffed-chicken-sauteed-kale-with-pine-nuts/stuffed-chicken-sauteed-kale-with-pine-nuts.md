notes:

ingredients:
- stuffing:

- 2|  tablespoons  jarred Pesto  approx. 62 calories/tablespoon
- 1|  tablespoon  2% Greek Yogurt
- 0.25|  cup  shredded Mozzarella
- 1|  tablespoon  grated Parmesan
- 1|  clove  Garlic  minced
- 0.25|  cup  sliced Sun-dried Tomatoes

- Chicken:

- 4|  Chicken Breasts  (approx. 5 ounces each, uncooked), pounded to 0.25|″ thick
- 0.25|  cup  Bread Crumbs
- 2| large eggs

- fixings:

- 1|  bunch  chopped Kale  stems removed (about 4 cups)
- 0.5| tablespoon  Butter
- 0.25|  cup  diced Onion
- 0.25|  cup  pine nuts

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375F.
- Mix together the pesto, yogurt, cheese, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes. Spread a thin layer on each chicken breast and roll it up, sealing with toothpicks.
- Set up two shallow bowls, one with whisked eggs, the other with bread crumbs. Dip chicken rolls in the eggs, followed by the bread crumbs, making sure to evenly coat each one. This can be a bit tricky at first, so try to weave the toothpick to “sew” up the chicken so none of the stuffing escapes.
- Heat a large, lightly greased skillet on medium-high and brown the chicken rolls on each side. Transfer chicken rolls to a lightly greased baking dish and bake until fully cooked, about 30 minutes.
- While the chicken bakes, prepare the kale, onions and pine nuts. Wash, pat dry, and separate stems. Heat butter in a large skillet and sauté onions on medium heat until translucent, then add pine nuts and toss for about two minutes. Transfer to a plate and then add kale to skillet with approximately two tablespoons water. Heat until wilted, about 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally,
- Serve chicken over sautéed kale topped with onions and pine nuts.
