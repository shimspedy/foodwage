Cooking oats on the stovetop is completely unnecessary when you use this technique to soak your oats. Antioxidant-rich pomegranate juice gives the oats a hint of pink, yogurt adds protein and a grated apple lends texture and sweetness. Topping your bowl with brilliant purple blackberries and some crunchy walnuts makes a meal that satisfies.
