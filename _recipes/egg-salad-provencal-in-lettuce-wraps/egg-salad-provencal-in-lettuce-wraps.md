Egg salad doesn’t have to be loaded with mayonnaise when you borrow the flavors of a Provencal salad. A lean vinaigrette, fragrant fresh basil and tangy olives give the salad plenty of zip — and juicy grape tomatoes keep it moist and delicious. Skip the bread and roll it in a tender leaf of bibb lettuce, for a high-protein snack you’ll crave again and again.
