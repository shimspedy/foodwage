ingredients:
- salad:

- 1|  large head cauliflower,  cut into 1|-inch florets
- 1| tablespoon  olive oil
- to taste  Kosher salt
- to taste  pepper
- 1| pound  baby potatoes  preferably Yukon Gold, halved and quartered if large
- 0.25| cup  tahini
- 3| tablespoons  lemon juice  freshly squeezed
- 2| tablespoons  Dijon mustard
- 1|  garlic clove  finely grated
- 2| tablespoons  sesame seeds  toasted
- 1| tablespoon  coriander seeds  toasted and lightly crushed
- 1| tablespoon  cumin seeds  toasted and lightly crushed
- 1| teaspoon  crushed red pepper
- 1| teaspoon  flaky sea salt
- 6| radishes  halved and quartered if large
- 0.5|  cup  red onion  lightly packed thinly sliced
- 2| cups  baby arugula  packed
- 1| cup  mixed herbs  such as basil, cilantro, dill, mint, parsley and chives, packed
- Lemon wedges  optional, for serving
- Olive oil  optional, for drizzling
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 500°F (260ºC). Spread the cauliflower florets on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast the cauliflower, tossing occasionally, until tender and browned in spots, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely.
- Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Season with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and then cook until the potatoes are fork tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and let cool completely.
- In a medium bowl, whisk the tahini with the lemon juice, mustard, garlic and 0.25 cup of warm water. Season with salt and pepper. Add more water if the dressing is too thick; it should be thin enough to pour.
- In a small bowl, mix the sesame seeds with the coriander, cumin, crushed red pepper and flaky sea salt.
- In a large bowl, combine the roasted cauliflower with the potatoes, radishes and red onion. Drizzle the lemon-tahini dressing over the top and toss gently to coat. Fold in the arugula and half of the mixed herbs. Transfer the potato salad to a serving bowl and garnish with the remaining mixed herbs. Squeeze a little more lemon juice over the top and drizzle with olive oil, if desired. Sprinkle generously with the dukkah and serve immediately.

Think of this dish as a Middle Eastern spin on your classic picnic potato salad, packed with more vegetables, fresh herbs and a bright-and-creamy tahini dressing. With 5 grams of fiber and its low-fat profile, this potato salad gives you all the indulgence of its traditional counterpart with more function and beneficial nutrients.
Since potato salad tends to have one texture throughout, this version is finished with a sprinkling of homemade dukkah, a crunchy Egyptian spice blend. For the best flavor, toast the spices separately yourself before mixing them together.
