ingredients:
- Quinoa Egg Power Bites:

- 1|  cup  dry quinoa  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 2|  cup  vegetable broth certified gluten-free if necessary
- 2|  tablespoon  ghee or extra-virgin olive oil
- 3|  large  eggs  lightly beaten
- 1|  medium  cucumber  shredded
- 0.5|  cup  pecorino cheese certified gluten-free if necessary
- 0.25|  cup  basil  julienned
- 2|  teaspoon  cumin
- 1|  teaspoon  cayenne
- 2|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 12|  whole pecans or walnuts  optional
- Hot sauce, to taste  optional

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F.
- Soak the quinoa for 5 minutes and drain. In a saucepan over high heat, combine the quinoa with the broth and 1 tablespoon of the ghee and bring it to a boil. Stir well, reduce the heat to low, and cook, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is fluffy.
- Combine the eggs, cucumber, cheese, basil, cumin, cayenne, salt, and remaining ghee in a large bowl. Stir in the quinoa.
- Pour the mixture into a 12-cup nonstick muffin tin and top with the nuts, if desired. Bake the power bites for 20 minutes. Remove them from the tin and let cool on a rack so you don’t burn your excited mouth. Douse them in hot sauce if you like an extra kick!
