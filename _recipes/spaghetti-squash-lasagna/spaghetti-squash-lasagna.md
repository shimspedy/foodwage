notes:


ingredients:
- Spaghetti Squash Lasagna:

- 1|  medium  spaghetti squash  about 4 cups cooked, divided
- 1.5|  cup  low-fat ricotta cheese  divided
- 1|  large  egg
- teaspoon  dried basil
- teaspoon  dried oregano
- 0.25|  teaspoon  garlic powder
- 1.5|  cup  thick marinara sauce  divided
- 4|  cup  fresh baby spinach  chopped and divided
- 0.5|  cup  part-skim mozzarella cheese  divided
- Grape tomatoes  optional garnish
- Red pepper flakes  optional garnish

directions:
- Slice spaghetti squash in half, remove the seeds and bake it flesh side down for 40 minutes at 350°F.
- To make this recipe quickly, use leftover spaghetti squash. Run a fork into the spaghetti squash to create strands, and throw away the skin. Use a paper towel to pat away excess moisture.
- Preheat the oven to 350°F.
- Combine the ricotta with the egg, basil, oregano, and garlic powder.
- Begin layering by placing 1/2 cup of the marinara sauce in the bottom of a greased 8×8 or 9×9 pan. Continue with 2 cups of cooked spaghetti squash, 3/4 cup of the ricotta mixture, 2 cups fresh chopped spinach, 1/2 cup marinara sauce, and 1/4 cup mozzarella. Repeat the process once with those same amounts (layering spaghetti squash, ricotta, spinach, pasta sauce, and finally mozzarella).
- Garnish with sliced grape tomatoes, any additional chopped spinach or mozzarella, and red pepper flakes.
- Bake uncovered for 30 minutes until bubbling.
- Let it sit for 10 minutes before slicing. To serve immediately, use a slotted spoon and allow any excess liquid to drain out of the pan. Leftovers will be even firmer and slice into nice squares.
