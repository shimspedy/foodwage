ingredients:
- Breakfast Stuffed Bell Peppers:

- 2|  medium  bell peppers
- 4|  slice  reduced-sodium bacon  chopped
- 2|  tablespoon  chopped onion
- 0.5|  cup  sliced mushrooms  2 ounces or 35 grams
- 6|  large  eggs  50 grams each
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.125|  teaspoon  black pepper
- 0.25|  cup  grated Cheddar cheese  1 ounce or 30 grams
- 1|  teaspoon  chopped chives

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F.
- Slice bell peppers in half, remove interior stem and seeds. Place in a 2-quart baking dish. Set aside. (If bell pepper bottoms are very rounded, place crumbled foil in between so peppers remain level when filled and baked.)
- Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat for 4 minutes or until crispy. Remove bacon, and drain on paper towels. Drain off all but 1 teaspoon bacon fat. In the same skillet, cook onions and mushrooms over medium heat about 4–5 minutes or until tender. Add spinach, and cook for 2 minutes, tossing occasionally with tongs. Drain excess liquid. Stir in bacon. Spoon mixture evenly into prepared pepper halves. Top each pepper with 1 tablespoon cheese.
- Whisk together eggs, salt, and pepper. Pour evenly into peppers. Bake 25–30 minutes, until eggs are set.
