ingredients:
- Huevos Rancheros-Inspired Chopped Salad:

- 1|  can  black beans  rinsed and drained
- 1|  cup  cherry tomatoes  halved
- 1|  ripe avocado
- 3|  tablespoon  olive oil vinaigrette dressing
- 0.33333333333|  cup  crumbled queso fresco or feta cheese  divided
- 0.25|  teaspoon  kosher salt  divided
- 6|  cup  romaine lettuce  thinly chopped
- 1|  teaspoon  olive oil
- 4|  large Eggland’s Best eggs
- 1|  cup  thin tortilla strips

directions:
- Combine beans, tomatoes, avocado, dressing, two tablespoons cheese and 1/8 tsp salt in a bowl, stirring to combine. Divide lettuce among 4 plates, and top evenly with bean mixture.
- Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add oil to skillet, turning to coat. Crack eggs into pan, being careful to not break the yolks. Sprinkle the eggs with the remaining 0.125 teaspoon salt, and cook them 2 minutes. Cover, and cook 2 more minutes or until the desired degree of doneness.
- Top each salad with a cooked egg. Sprinkle each salad evenly with remaining cheese and tortilla strips.
- Look for packages of thin tortilla strips in the produce section or on the aisle with croutons and salad dressings. You can also make your own by cutting corn tortillas into 0.5 inch strips (a pizza cutter works great for this). Lightly spray with cooking spray, sprinkle with a dash of salt or taco seasoning, and bake for 10 minutes or until golden, turning once.

All the great flavors the classic Huevos Rancheros dish is known for have been combined to create this chopped salad that’s packed full of protein and fiber. Substitute queso fresco for pepitas or extra avocado, if desired.
