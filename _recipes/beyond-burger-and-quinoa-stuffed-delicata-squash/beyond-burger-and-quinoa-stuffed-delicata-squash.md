ingredients:
- Beyond Burger and Quinoa Stuffed Delicata Squash:

- 2|  medium  delicata squash
- 3|  tsp  olive oil
- 1|  cup  Beyond Meat crumbles, or other meatless crumbles
- 1|  small onion  chopped
- 2|  stalks celery  chopped
- 0.5|  quinoa  rinsed and drained
- 2|  tsp  poultry seasoning or dried sage
- 1|  medium garlic clove  chopped
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 2|  tbsp  dried cranberries
- 2|  tbsp  finely chopped Italian parsley

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350° (177°C). Slice the squash in half and remove the seeds. Brush the cut sides of the squash with 1 teaspoon of olive oil and place cut side down on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake until the squash is tender when pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes.
- Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the crumbles and sauté until browned in places and heated through, 2 minutes. Pour into a medium bowl and set aside.
- Return saucepan to stove and add the remaining oil. Add the onions and celery and sauté until tender, 3 minutes. Add the quinoa, poultry seasoning and garlic, and sauté until fragrant, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and add 1 scant cup water and salt. Cover and simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes.
- Combine the crumbles, quinoa mixture, dried cranberries and parsley, stirring to combine. Turn the baked squash cut side up on the baking sheet. Carefully mound the quinoa stuffing into the squash cavities and bake until heated through, 10–15 minutes.
- The roasted stuffed squash can be made up to 3 days ahead. Do not bake the stuffed squash, instead, store in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. To finish, cover the squash with foil and bake in a 350°F (177°C) oven until heated through, 30 minutes.
