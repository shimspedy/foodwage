Can you enjoy cookies with no sugar and none of the artificial stuff? Sure you can! Skinnytaste’s recipe for chewy chocolate chip breakfast cookies whips together just 3 simple ingredients: ripe bananas, wholesome oats and chocolate chips! You can make a batch of these the night before and watch them disappear at the breakfast table.
