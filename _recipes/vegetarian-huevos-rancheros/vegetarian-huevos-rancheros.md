ingredients:
- Huevos Rancheros:

- 4| Corn Tortillas  6″ in diameter; certified gluten-free if necessary
- 2| cups  cooked Kidney Beans
- 3| tablespoons  chopped Green Onion  (approx. 3| stalks)
- 1| tablespoon Butter or Oil
- 0.5| cup Vegetable Broth  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 0.25| cup  chopped large Red Bell Pepper  (approx. 0.33| large pepper)
- 2| pinches Baking Soda
- 2| teaspoons Apple Cider Vinegar
- 8| ounce  Extra Firm Tofu
- 1| teaspoon Turmeric
- 0.5| teaspoon Cumin
- 4| tablespoons canned Green Chile

directions:
- Remove the tofu from the package and press under something heavy to squeeze out some of the extra moisture. Set aside to press while you start the beans.
- To make the beans, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add beans, green onion, red bell pepper and broth. Simmer for 4-6 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and baking soda. Begin to mash the beans using the back of a wooden spoon and cook for another 2 minutes until liquid is absorbed an beans are well mashed.
- Place the pressed tofu in a medium bowl. Using a butter knife, roughly chop into ½” pieces. Heat a non-stick skillet over low heat and add the tofu. Sprinkle with turmeric and cumin and stir to evenly coat. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until the tofu is no longer releasing excess moisture.
- Toast the corn tortillas for 2-3 minutes in a toaster oven until crisp.
- Assemble huevos rancheros by spreading the ¼ of the bean mixture on a tortilla, then topping with ¼ the “eggs”, 1 tablespoon green chile and other desired toppings
