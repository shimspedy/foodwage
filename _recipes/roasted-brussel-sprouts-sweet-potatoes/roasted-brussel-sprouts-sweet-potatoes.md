ingredients:
- Roasted Brussel Sprouts & Sweet Potatoes:

- 4|  cup  brussels sprouts  trimmed and halved
- 1|  large  sweet potato  chopped into 1/2-inch chunks
- 3|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  teaspoon  garlic powder
- 0.5|  teaspoon  ground cumin
- 4|  teaspoon  sea salt  or to taste
- 0.25|  cup  raw pecans
- 0.33333333333|  cup  feta cheese
- 0.33333333333|  cup  balsamic vinegar

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F.
- Add the brussels sprouts, sweet potato, olive oil, garlic powder, cumin, allspice, and sea salt to a small casserole dish (8-inch by 8-inch or 9-inch by 13-inch will both work!). Toss everything together to coat the veggies.
- Place on the center rack of the oven and bake 45 to 60 minutes, stirring once half-way through, or until veggies are golden-brown and cooked through.
- In a small saucepan, heat the balsamic vinegar over medium-high, and bring to a full boil. Cook at a full (but controlled) boil, stirring frequently until vinegar is reduced by 1/2 of its original volume, about 5 minutes.
- Taste veggies for flavor and add salt to taste. Serve roasted veggies with pecans, feta, and balsamic reduction drizzled on top.
