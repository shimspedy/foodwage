Turn a childhood favorite, the fully loaded baked potato, into a hearty, warm bowl of soup — all fixings included. Fiber-rich cauliflower makes the soup more filling with less calories. And with both bacon and broccoli, this creamy soup is nutritious and packed with flavor. The potato peels are left on for added nutrition and less prep.
