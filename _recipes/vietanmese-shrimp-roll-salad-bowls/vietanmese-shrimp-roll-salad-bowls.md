These noodle bowls are full of the crunchy, fresh veggies you find in salad rolls, without all the fuss of rolling them in wrappers. Plus, this is a one dish meal with a cup of veggies per serving, lean protein and whole-grain brown rice noodles (which have 3 grams more fiber per serving than white-rice noodles). The zingy lime-garlic dressing ties it all together; add more Sriracha if you like spicy noodles.
