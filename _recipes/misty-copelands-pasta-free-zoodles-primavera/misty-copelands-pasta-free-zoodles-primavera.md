ingredients:
- Misty Copeland’s Pasta-Free Zoodles Primavera:

- 4|  medium zucchini  ends trimmed
- 4|  tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
- 2|  cloves garlic  minced
- 1|  small onion,  chopped (about 1/2 cup)
- 1|  cup  broccoli florets
- 2|  cup  spinach  tightly packed
- 0.5|  cup  sliced mushrooms
- 0.5|  red bell pepper  chopped (about 1/2 cup)
- Salt and pepper
- 1|  teaspoon  dried Italian spices typically a medley of basil, oregano, rosemary, onion powder and garlic powder — available in a jar
- 0.5|  cup  grated Parmesan cheese
- Spiralizer  Special equipment

directions:
- To create the “zoodles,” insert the zucchini into the spiralizer, one at a time, much like you’d sharpen a pencil. (Please follow the manufacturer’s instructions.) Set aside the vegetable noodles.
- In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onion and cook until translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the broccoli, spinach, mushrooms and bell pepper. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook on medium, stirring frequently, for 5–7 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender.
- Add the spiralized zucchini and dried Italian spices. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Top with the cheese and serve.

In her book, “Ballerina Body,” Misty Copeland, the first African-American female principal dancer for American Ballet Theater, knows that you don’t have to sacrifice taste for health. Living her passion, she approaches her daily meals just like she approaches dancing. In the chapter entitled “Meal Choreography,” she breaks down meal-planning suggestions for 21 days. The noodles in this recipe, made entirely of zucchini, are just one way Misty manages to pack ample servings of veggies into her meals everyday.  This dish allows you to satisfy your pasta cravings but substitutes delicious vegetables — zucchini, spinach and broccoli — for the pasta. With the addition of Italian seasoning, garlic and Parmesan cheese, I don’t think you’ll miss the spaghetti!
