notes:


ingredients:
- Parmesan Smashed Potatoes:

- 3|  pound  baby potatoes  try yellow flesh potatoes
- 0.25|  cup  olive oil
- 1|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.5|  teaspoon  white pepper
- 1|  cup  grated parmesan cheese  divided
- 2|  teaspoon  dried parsley

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F (204ºC). Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
- Place baby potatoes in a large stock pot and fill with water so it just covers the potatoes. Salt the water generously.
- Bring the water to a boil and then turn heat down to medium heat. Continue to cook for about 15 to 20 minutes. You want the potatoes to be fork tender but not falling apart.
- Drain the water from the potatoes, and rinse them. When able to handle without burning your hands, place the potatoes on the cookie sheet.
- Take the underside of a water glass and lightly press it down on each potato until you break the skin and slightly flatten each one. Continue until all the potatoes are “smashed”.
- Evenly drizzle olive oil over top of the potatoes. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt and pepper. Then, place half of the cheese (about 1/2 cup) over top of the potatoes carefully so you don’t waste any of that precious cheese.
- Place the cookie sheet in the preheated 400°F oven and cook for 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with the remaining cheese (1/2 cup) and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. You want the potatoes to start to brown and get a little crispy around the edges. You want the cheese to melt perfectly so it’s heavenly to bite into. Cook according to how crispy you like your potato.
- Remove the sheet from the oven and transfer potatoes to a platter. Toss with dried parsley, more or less depending on your taste
