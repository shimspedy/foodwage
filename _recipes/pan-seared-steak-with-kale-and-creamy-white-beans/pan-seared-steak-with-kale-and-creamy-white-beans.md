ingredients:
- Pan-Seared Steak with Kale and Creamy White Beans:

- hanger steak
- 0.75|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.5|  teaspoon  coarsely ground black pepper
- 4|  teaspoon  olive oil  divided
- 2|  medium garlic cloves  finely chopped
- 1|  tablespoon  fresh rosemary  chopped
- 1|  package baby kale leaves  about 5 cups, packed
- 1|  can cannellini or great northern beans  drained and rinsed
- 0.5|  cup  low-sodium chicken broth

directions:
- Place a cast iron or ovenproof skillet in the oven and preheat to 425°F. Allow the steak to sit at room temperature while the oven is preheating. Cut the steak into 2 equal pieces in order to fit into the pan, if needed. Season with 0.5 teaspoon of the salt and all the pepper. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of the oil.
- Carefully transfer the hot pan to the stovetop and turn the heat on high. Sear the meat until it develops a nice, brown crust, 3 minutes. Turn over with tongs and return the pan to the oven. Roast until medium rare, about 5 minutes (an instant-read thermometer will read 135°F). Remove pan from oven and transfer the meat to a cutting board. Loosely cover with foil and set aside for 10 minutes.
- While the steak is resting, make the kale and beans. Place the remaining tablespoon of oil in the skillet and heat over medium heat. Add the garlic and rosemary and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add the kale, beans and remaining 0.25 teaspoon of salt. Toss with tongs to wilt the greens, 2 minutes. Add the broth and simmer for 1 minute, mashing about half of the beans with a fork to make the mixture creamy. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until ready to serve.
- Thinly slice the steak against the grain and serve on top of the kale-bean mixture.

Hanger steak is a long, flat cut, also called the “butcher’s cut,” that is exceptionally tender and full of beefy flavor. It’s also budget-friendly compared to more familiar premium cuts. Be sure to cut it across the grain into thin slices and don’t cook it past medium rare for the juiciest, most tender meat.
