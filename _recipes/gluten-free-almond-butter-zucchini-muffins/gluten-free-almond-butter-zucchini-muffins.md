time: under 17 mins
servings: 24

notes:
- The tops of the muffins rise nicely in the oven but will deflate a bit as they cool. I also noticed that the top of the muffins stay a little moist. For this reason I recommend storing the leftover muffins in an airtight container in the fridge or the freezer. They freeze really nicely and you can quickly thaw them in the toaster oven or by just letting them sit out at room temperature for a bit.

ingredients:
- Gluten-Free Almond Butter Zucchini Muffins:

- 1|  cup  zucchini  grated
- 1|  cup  creamy almond butter
- 0.25|  cup  maple syrup
- 2|  large  eggs
- 0.5|  tbsp  chia seeds
- 1|  tsp  apple cider vinegar
- 1|  tsp  cinnamon
- 1|  tsp  vanilla
- 0.5|  tsp  baking soda
- 0.25|  tsp  salt
- 2|  tbsp  dark chocolate chips or chunks certified gluten-free if necessary
directions:
- Pre-heat oven to 375°F (191°C) and prepare a mini muffin tin by spraying well with cooking spray, or line the tins with paper liners. Set aside.
- Add all ingredients except chocolate chips into a medium-sized mixing bowl and stir until well combined. Gently stir in chocolate chips.
- Fill each muffin cavity about ¾ full with the muffin mixture.
- Bake for 7-8 minutes, or until the tops are set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean without any batter. Allow muffins to cool for 5-10 minutes or until they are firm enough and cool enough to handle. Remove from tin and let cool completely on a wire rack. If they’re sticking at all, use a butter knife to go along the rim of the muffin tin to help you detach the muffin from the tin and get them out in one piece.
- Muffins are always best fresh, but these will keep airtight in the fridge for about 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months.
