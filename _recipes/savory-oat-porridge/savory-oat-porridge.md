ingredients:
- For the oats:

- 4|  tbsp  Quaker Oats quick oats
- 1|  cup  low-sodium vegetable stock
- 0.66666666666|  cup  water
- 3|  tbsp  torch ginger,  (3g or 3 small leaves) cut into a chiffonade
- 0.25|  tsp  fine sea salt

- For the fried shallots & garlic sesame oil:

- 0.33333333333|  cup  sesame oil  for frying the shallots
- 3|  shallots  peeled and sliced thinly from root to tip
- 7|  cloves garlic  peeled and minced small
- 0.125|  tsp  fine sea salt

- For the topping:

- 1|  teaspoon  spring onions  diced small
- 1|  tsp  coriander  leaves only, diced small
directions:
- In a heavy-bottomed pan or cast-iron skillet, heat sesame oil over medium heat until it gets quite bubbly. Throw in a slice of shallot to test the temperature. It should immediately start sizzling. If it doesn’t, heat the oil another minute or two.
- Once the oil is hot enough, add a pinch of salt to the sliced shallots and stir to mix. Do not salt the shallots too early as this will draw out their moisture and sweetness. Add shallots to hot sesame oil. Stir occasionally while keeping an eye on the shallots. You want the shallots to caramelize, crisp and turn a nice golden brown. While waiting, line a plate with paper towels.
- When shallots are done (after about 8 minutes), remove from the oil with a slotted ladle, tossing lightly to get rid of excess oil. Spread your shallots over the paper towel-lined plate to soak up the excess oil.
- After removing all the shallots, add minced garlic to the sesame oil. Stir occasionally to cook garlic until it has caramelized but not darkened, about 4–5 minutes. Remove garlic and sesame oil from the heat and let cool thoroughly before storing in an airtight jar.
- In a small pot, combine vegetable stock and water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once the mixture is boiling, add in oats and stir to mix. Next, stir 2 tablespoons of torch flower into the oats. Cook according to packet instructions, stirring occasionally, or until the oats have absorbed most of the liquid. Before transferring your savory oats porridge into a bowl, give it a taste. Add a pinch of sea salt if necessary. Mix thoroughly.-   To complete your savory oat porridge, pour in a couple tablespoons of garlic sesame oil — don’t forget to scoop out that garlic first — and liberally toss in some spring onions, coriander, fried shallots and fresh torch ginger. Stir everything through or leave it as is and enjoy! Oat porridge is best served soon after cooking as the oats continue to absorb more liquid and become thicker as it rests.

Not only do crispy shallots give this savory oatmeal a delicious texture, but they’re also rich in flavonoids, a type of antioxidant that helps protect against cancer, heart disease and diabetes. And low-sodium vegetable stock is another great way to add extra flavor while saving on calories.
