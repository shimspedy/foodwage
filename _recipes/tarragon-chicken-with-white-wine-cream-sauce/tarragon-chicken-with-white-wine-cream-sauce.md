ingredients:
- Tarragon Chicken with White Wine Cream Sauce:

- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  pearl onions  peeled and halved
- 4|  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 0.5|  teaspoon  dried tarragon leaves
- 0.25|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  black pepper
- 3|  cup  green beans  sliced diagonally
- 0.5|  cup  dry white wine
- 0.25|  cup  heavy whipping cream
- 1|  teaspoon  Dijon mustard
- 1|  tablespoon  fresh tarragon leaves  chopped

directions:
- Heat oil in a large skillet set over medium. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 2 minutes.
- Season chicken with dried tarragon, salt and pepper. Increase heat on skillet to medium-high. Add chicken and cook until browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken over and add beans; cook until beans are tender and chicken is no longer pink inside, about 5–7 minutes more.
- Arrange chicken, beans and onions on serving plates and cover to keep warm. Add wine to skillet, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until reduced by half, about 3–4 minutes. Add cream and mustard, stirring to combine. Continue cooking until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 1–2 minutes more. Pour sauce over chicken, dividing evenly. Garnish with fresh tarragon.
