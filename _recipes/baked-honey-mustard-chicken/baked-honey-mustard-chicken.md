notes:
- Make sure the chicken breasts are fully cooked by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast to assure an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit. If you don’t have a meat thermometer, slice into the thickest part of the breast to assure there is no pink.

- 1|  teaspoon  Smoked Paprika
- 1|  tablespoon  fresh Lemon Juice

- to taste  Pepper

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375 Fahrenheit.
- Rinse and pat dry chicken breasts and place in a large glass dish. Season them with sea salt and pepper.
- In a small bowl, stir together the remaining ingredients and pour over the chicken. Flip each one over a few times to coat it well.
- Cook for 45-50 minutes, turning and basting them half way through.
