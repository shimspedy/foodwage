notes:


ingredients:
- 4|  large tomatoes  cored and sliced in half crosswise
- Salt and pepper  to taste
- 8|  large eggs  plus 3 egg yolks, divided
- 1|  cup  plain, whole-milk Greek yogurt
- 2|  teaspoon  lemon juice
- 1|  tablespoon  unsalted butter  plus 2 teaspoons, divided
- 0.5|  teaspoon  dried mustard
- 2|  cup  button or white mushrooms  halved
- 3|  cup  loosely packed spinach
- 1|  tablespoon  white vinegar
- 2|  tablespoon  chopped fresh chives

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). In a baking dish, place tomatoes cut sides up. Mist with cooking spray, and season with salt and pepper. Roast until tender and slightly shriveled about 30 minutes.
- Meanwhile, place a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water; in a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, yogurt, and lemon juice. Cook, whisking often, for 5–8 minutes or until thick. (Note-  Mixture will appear thick at first, then will thin out and thicken again.) Remove bowl from heat and whisk in 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon butter and mustard until smooth. Season with additional salt. Cover and set aside.
- In a large skillet on medium-high, heat the remaining 1 teaspoon butter. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until softened, 3–4 minutes. Add spinach, and cook 1–2 minutes, stirring often, until spinach is wilted. Remove from heat, cover and set aside.
- Poach eggs- Fill a large, shallow saucepan with 3 inches water; bring to a boil. Add vinegar, and reduce heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer. In a small dish, break 1 egg and gently slip into simmering water. Repeat with remaining eggs and cook for 3–4 minutes, or until they reach desired doneness. (Note- It may be easiest to do this in 2 batches of 4 eggs each.)
- Divide spinach-mushroom mixture among plates and nestle 2 baked tomato halves on top. Top each tomato with a poached egg, then spoon sauce over top and sprinkle with chives.
