notes:


ingredients:
- Sweet Potato Rounds with Guacamole:

- 1|  large sweet potato
- Cooking spray
- Salt  to taste
- 2|  slices  thick-cut bacon  chopped
- Green onions  chopped, optional garnish
- Grated cotija cheese  optional garnish

- For the guacamole:

- 1|  large avocado  peeled
- 2|  tablespoon  fresh lime juice
- 1|  jalapeño  seeded and finely chopped
- 1|  clove garlic  minced
- 3| tablespoon  finely chopped red onion
- Salt  to taste

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F (205)°C. Slice the sweet potato into 1/2-inch thick rounds. (You should have 12 slices.) Lightly coat both sides of the sweet potato slices with cooking spray, sprinkle with salt and place on a baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes, flip, then bake for another 10–15 minutes, or until rounds are cooked through and crispy on the edges. Remove from heat and let cool.
- Meanwhile, cook bacon over medium heat, flipping occasionally, until crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to a cutting board and chop into pieces once cool enough to handle.
- Mash guacamole ingredients with a fork until desired consistency is reached.
- Top sweet potato rounds with guacamole, bacon, green onion and cotija cheese, if using.

The Roasted Root’s sweet potato rounds with creamy guacamole and crispy bacon are arguably better than chips — and a lot healthier! Bring this ingenious appetizer to any gathering, and it’ll be gobbled up in no time. (Cotija is a salty, creamy Mexican cheese that is often used for garnish in Mexican dishes. If you can’t find it, swap in feta.)
