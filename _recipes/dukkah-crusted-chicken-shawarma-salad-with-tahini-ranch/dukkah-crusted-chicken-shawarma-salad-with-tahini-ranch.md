ingredients:
- salad:

- 2|  whole-wheat pita bread pockets  6-inch/15cm
- 0.25| cup  hazelnuts  very finely chopped
- 2| teaspoons  ground coriander
- 1.5| teaspoons  sesame seeds
- 1| teaspoon  ground cumin
- 0.25| teaspoon  ground black pepper
- 0.25| teaspoon  salt
- 8| ounces  boneless skinless chicken breast tenders
- 2| teaspoons  olive oil
- 4| cups  mixed baby greens
- 1| pound  ripe tomatoes  cored and diced
- 1|  medium cucumber  seeded and chopped
- 0.25| cup  green onions  thinly sliced
- 0.25| cup  Italian parsley or mint  roughly chopped

- dressing:

- 2| tablespoons  tahini
- 1| tablespoon  lemon juice
- 0.5|  teaspoon garlic  finely chopped
- 0.75| teaspoon  maple syrup
- 0.25| teaspoon  black pepper
- 2| teaspoons  olive oil

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350ºF (177ºC). Tear the pita into bite-sized pieces and arrange on a baking sheet in an even layer. Lightly coat with cooking spray and bake until golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Set aside
- Make the dukkah: In a dry sauté pan, toast the hazelnuts, coriander, sesame seeds and cumin over medium heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 2 minutes. Pour into a small bowl immediately to avoid the mixture from over-toasting. Stir in the salt and pepper.
- Pre-heat a grill pan or non-stick sauté pan over medium heat. Rub the dukkah all over the chicken and drizzle with 2 teaspoons of the oil. Grill the chicken until cooked through, 3–4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the tenders. Reduce the heat if the coating becomes too dark. Transfer tenders to a cutting board and set aside.

This easy summer salad has a dose of healthy fats, high-fiber carbohydrates, refreshing vegetables and lean protein. It features chicken breast tenders breaded with dukkah that’s a snap to prepare. Toasted whole-grain pita stands in for croutons here; be sure to add them to the salad just before serving or they become mushy.
