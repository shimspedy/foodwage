Using your oven to “fry” chicken is a great way to satisfy your deep-friend chicken cravings with a lot less fat and calories. Make your baked chicken more interesting by switching up the breading: Try crushed cornflakes, bran flakes or panko breadcrumbs. Chicken strips are boneless, full of lean protein and add a lot of crunch to any meal.
