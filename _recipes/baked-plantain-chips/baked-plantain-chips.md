notes:


ingredients:
- Baked Plantain Chips:

- 2|  green plantains  unripe
- 3|  tablespoon  oil
- 1|  teaspoon  salt

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a baking sheet.
- Slice the ends off the green plantains and use a knife to cut slits down the sides of the peel. This will allow you to pull off the skin (it is hard to remove).
- Slice the plantains into 1/8-inch rounds (thinner slices will yield crispier chips). Place them on the prepared baking sheet, crowding them close but not overlapping.
- Drizzle the additional oil over the plantain slices, and sprinkle salt on top.
- Bake the plantain chips for 23–25 minutes, or until browned and dry.
- Allow the plantain chips to cool for 20 minutes before enjoying them.
- To store, let chips cool for at least 1 hour before sealing them in an airtight container. If you seal them before cooled, they will lose their crispiness. They will last 5–6 days

Swap your store-bought fried plantain chips for a batch of Uproot Kitchen’s three-ingredient baked plantain chips. A blank slate for flavor, these green plantains pair well with a vast array of dishes, like tacos and enchiladas, or as a crunchy snack on its own!
