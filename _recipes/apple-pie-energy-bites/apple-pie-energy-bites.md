These nutrient-dense treats are packed with dried apples, toasted nuts, oats and cinnamon. They’re a great balanced snack with fiber, protein, healthy fats and whole grains — and they taste like portable apple pies. They’re finished with coconut, but you could also dip them in melted white chocolate for an extra-indulgent treat.
