ingredients:
- Honey Vanilla Frozen Yogurt With Caramelized Pineapple:

- 24|  ounce  plain, full-fat Greek yogurt
- 0.25|  cup  local honey
- 2|  tsp  vanilla extract  divided
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 1.5|  tsp  unsalted butter
- fresh pineapple  cut into 0.5| inch (1.3cm) chunks
- 1|  star anise
- 2|  tsp  brown sugar  packed
- 0.25|  tsp  ground cinnamon
- 0.125|  tsp  ground nutmeg

directions:
- In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, honey, 1 teaspoon of the vanilla and salt. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer’s instructions. Scrape into an airtight container and freeze until firm. Alternatively, pour the mixture into a large zip-top bag and freeze, squishing the bag to break up any frozen chunks every hour, until completely frozen, 4–5 hours. (Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes if the mixture is too firm to scoop.)
- To make the pineapple, melt the butter in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the pineapple and star anise. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until the pineapple is caramelized, about 10 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons (44ml) water, brown sugar, the remaining teaspoon of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Increase heat to medium and simmer until the juices are thick and syrupy, 4 minutes.
- Scoop the frozen yogurt into bowls and spoon the warm pineapple over the top.

Protein comes naturally in this decadent-but-healthy “ice cream.” Vitamin C-rich pineapple becomes buttery and full of sweetness when sautéed with spices and vanilla. It’s a perfect topping for this easy frozen yogurt treat, and there are just 200 calories per generous serving. If you don’t have an ice cream maker, follow the alternate instructions in the recipe.
