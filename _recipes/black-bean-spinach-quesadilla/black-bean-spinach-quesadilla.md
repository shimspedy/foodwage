ingredients:
- Quesadilla:

- 0.5| tablespoon  extra virgin olive oil
- 1| teaspoon  minced garlic
- 8| ounces  cremini mushrooms  rinsed, stems trimmed, and sliced
- 0.25| teaspoon  chili powder  or to taste
- 4| cups  loosely packed baby spinach
- 1| cup  canned black beans  rinsed and drained
- 2| tablespoons  minced fresh or jarred jalapeño chiles  optional
- to taste  freshly ground pepper
- to taste  Salt
- 4|  whole wheat tortillas  (approx. 9-10″ in diameter) or smaller corn tortillas
- 1| cup  shredded reduced-fat Monterey Jack cheese
- Fresh cilantro leaves  for garnish
directions:
- In a large nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 20 seconds, then add the mushrooms and chili powder and saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until mushrooms are light golden and most of the juices have evaporated. Add spinach and stir until wilted, then add the black beans and jalapeños (if desired) and stir well until combined. Season with salt and pepper, transfer to bowl, and set aside. Wipe skillet with paper towel and set aside
- Lay the tortillas on a flat surface. Sprinkle one half of each round with an equal amount of cheese, then divide the mushroom filling equally over the cheese. Fold each tortilla in half.
- Reheat the skillet over medium heat. Place one of the quesadillas in the skillet (add a second one if it fits) and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, or until the cheese melts and the inside is warm. Continue to cook the remaining quesadillas. Serve promptly.
