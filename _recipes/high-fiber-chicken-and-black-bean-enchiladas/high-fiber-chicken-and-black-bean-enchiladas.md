- 0.5|  small  yellow or white onion,  finely chopped
- 2|  garlic cloves  minced
- 2|  boneless, skinless chicken breasts  cut into strips
- 0.75|  teaspoon  ground cumin
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 1|  cup  low-sodium canned black beans  rinsed and drained (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 0.5|  cup  fresh or frozen and thawed yellow corn
- 0.25|  cup  chopped cilantro, divided  plus 1 tablespoon (5 ml)
- 0.75|  cup  prepared tomatillo salsa or salsa verde, divided  certified gluten-free if necessary

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F. Heat oil in over medium in a large nonstick skillet. Add the onion, garlic, chicken, cumin and salt. Cook, stirring often, for 3–5 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Stir in the black beans and corn; cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat, and stir in 1/4 cup cilantro and 3 tablespoons of the salsa.
- Stack tortillas on a plate; cover with damp paper towel. Microwave on high for 15 to 30 seconds until hot and pliable.
- Lightly coat a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spoon a heaping 1/3 cup of the chicken mixture in center of a tortilla. Roll up, and arrange in baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Spoon the remaining salsa over the enchiladas.
