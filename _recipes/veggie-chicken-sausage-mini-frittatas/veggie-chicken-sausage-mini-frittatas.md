ingredients:
- Veggie & Chicken Sausage Mini Frittatas:

- 2|  teaspoon  olive oil
- 0.25|  teaspoon  ground black pepper
- 0.25|  cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
- 1|  cup  shredded mozzarella cheese
- 0.5|  cup  plain yogurt
- 8|  large eggs
- 1.5|  cup  grape tomatoes  halved
- 2|  large cloves garlic  minced
- 4|  links all-natural Italian chicken sausage  cooked and thinly sliced
- 0.125|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.75|  cup  chopped yellow onion
- 2|  small yellow potatoes  peeled and diced

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400ºF. Mist a 12-count muffin tin with cooking spray.
- In a medium skillet, heat oil on medium-low heat. Add potatoes, onion and salt and sauté for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender. Add sausage, garlic and tomatoes, and sauté for 2 minutes more. Divide mixture among muffin tins and allow to cool for about 10 minutes.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs and yogurt. Stir in cheese, basil and pepper. Divide evenly among muffin cups. Bake for 20 minutes, until puffed and set.
- Remove from oven and let cool for about 20 minutes. Slide a knife around each frittata and gently remove, placing on a large rimmed baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours, then transfer to a large zip-top freezer bag. Return to freezer until ready to serve, up to 1 month.
- To serve, preheat oven to 400ºF. Place frozen frittatas on a rimmed baking sheet misted with cooking spray and bake for 20 minutes, until heated through. A microwave may also be used, if desired. Frittatas can also be eaten cold; defrost overnight in the refrigerator.
