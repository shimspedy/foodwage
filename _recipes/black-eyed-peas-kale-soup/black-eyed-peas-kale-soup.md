tags:  healthy stew soup
meal: lunch dinner
chef: foodwage
time: under 2 hour 10 mins
servings: 6

notes:
- If you have a lot of flexibility in the cooking process- if you enjoy your beans very cooked/very soft simply cook for much longer. If you like your vegetables and beans not as soft, cook for less time.

ingredients:
- Soup:

- 1| pound dried black-eyed peas
- 2| quarts vegetable stock
- 4|  cups  kale  chopped
- 6| large carrots  chopped
- 2|  stalks  celery
- 1|  small onion  diced
- 2|  cloves garlic  minced
- 2| tablespoons  coconut oil
- 1| teaspoon  dried rosemary
- 1| teaspoon dried sage
- 1| teaspoon cumin
- 1|  dash  red pepper flakes
- to taste  black pepper
- to taste  sea salt
- to taste  hot sauce  Optional garnish

directions:
- In a saucepan on medium heat, add coconut oil and onions and cook until softened. Add in celery, carrots, and garlic and cook until the mixture is nice and caramelized and cooked through (look for the onions to get slightly golden brown and reduced).
- Add spices (rosemary, sage, cumin, pepper flakes), salt, and pepper to this mixture.
- In a large pot or crockpot (which is what I used), pour in vegetable stock, beans, and kale.
- Add the sauteed mixture of onions, carrots, celery into the Crockpot and let cook on “high” for 2 hours, stiring occasionally, and cooking for another 1-2 hours on “warm” or until the beans are cooked.
- If you’re using a large pot on the stove, simply cook on medium heat for 2 hours or until the beans are nice and soft.
- Stir occasionally and taste test to find your happy medium. Enjoy!
