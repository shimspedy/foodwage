ingredients:
- roasted chickpeas and carrots:

- 1|  cup  chickpeas
- 1|  tbsp  olive oil  divided
- 2|  large carrots
- 0.5|  tsp  cumin
- 0.5|  tsp  paprika
- 0.25|  tsp  turmeric

- dressing and salad:

- 3|  tbsp  orange juice
- 0.25|  cup  greek yogurt 0%
- 0.25|  tsp  cumin
- 0.25|  tsp  cinnamon
- 0.25|  tsp  salt
- 1|  orange zested and sectioned
- 2|  cups  spinach

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Place the drained chickpeas on a kitchen towel and fold the towel over to enclose the chickpeas. Rub gently and open up the towel, the skins of the chickpeas should have loosened so you can remove them. This step really improves the texture of the chickpeas. Place the skinned chickpeas on a sheet pan.
- Use a chef’s knife to slice the carrots into 0.33333333333| inch thick, long slices; cut the strips in half and place on a sheet pan.
- Drizzle half of the tablespoon of olive oil over each pan and toss to coat. Place the pans in the oven and roast for 25–30 minutes.
- While the ingredients roast, mix the cumin, paprika and turmeric in a cup and reserve. When the chickpeas are crunchy and the carrots are tender when pierced with a knife and have some browned spots, take the pans out. Sprinkle both pans with the spice mixture and shake the pans to coat evenly. Cool on racks. When cool, transfer to bowls and chill, if not eating immediately.
- Make the dressing by combining the orange juice and Greek yogurt in a small bowl and stirring until smooth, then stirring in the cumin, cinnamon and salt. Zest the orange to make 2 teaspoons (10ml) zest and stir that into the dressing, then section the orange to use in the salad.
- On two dinner-sized plates, spread the spinach, then top each with half of the roasted carrots, half of the orange and half of the roasted chickpeas. Drizzle each salad with half of the dressing (about 3 tablespoons) and serve.

If you’re looking for a salad that really satisfies, this is the one. Spiced, nutty chickpeas top a pile of sweet roasted carrots, juicy orange segments and spinach, for a variety of textures and flavors in every bite. The creamy, orange-spiked dressing brings it all together, and delivers even more protein with Greek yogurt.
