notes:

ingredients:
- Spaghetti Squash:
- 1|  medium spaghetti squash
- 2|  teaspoons  extra virgin olive oil
- 2|  teaspoons  minced garlic
- 0.25| teaspoon  salt
- 0.25| teaspoon  ground pepper

- Tomato sauce:

- 0.25|  cup  raw cashews  soaked
- 1|  can  ow sodium diced fire roasted tomatoes  15 ounce
- 0.25|  cup  basil leaves  chopped
- 2|  tablespoons  water
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- to taste  Red pepper flakes  optional
directions:
- Place cashews in a bowl and cover with water. Allow them to soak for at least 2 hours or overnight. (I bring water to a boil in a tea kettle, cover the cashews with the hot water, and let them soak for 30 minutes when I’m in a hurry.)
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Slice spaghetti squash in half. Scoop out seeds and stringy flesh with a spoon. Rub a teaspoon of olive oil over each half (inside, not outside). Rub with garlic and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
- Place face down on a baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes.
- Meanwhile, place the sauce ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth and creamy. Set aside.
- Use a fork to shred the spaghetti squash into strands. Heat a pan over medium heat. Place squash in a pan and cover with sauce (I used about 2/3 of the sauce and saved the rest). Toss to combine until warmed through.
- Top with fresh basil and red pepper flakes prior to serving.
