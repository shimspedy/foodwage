ingredients:
- Chicken and Wild Rice Bowl With Brussels Sprouts:

- 0.75|  cup  wild rice
- 2|  tbsp  olive oil  divided
- 12|  medium Brussels sprouts  trimmed and halved
- 1|  large carrot  halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
- 1|  tsp  fresh lemon juice
- chicken breast  thinly sliced
- 1|  tsp  dried thyme
- 0.5|  tbsp  dried sage
- 2|  tbsp  chicken stock
- 1|  tsp  tamari soy sauce
- 2|  medium scallions,  thinly sliced
directions:
- Bring about 3 cups (735ml) of water to a boil in a small pot over high heat. Add the wild rice, return to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for about 20 minutes for hand harvested wild rice, or up to 45 minutes for cultivated wild rice. When the rice is tender, drain and keep warm.
- In a large skillet, spread 1 teaspoon olive oil and place over medium-high heat. Place the Brussels sprouts in the pan, cut side down and sprinkle the carrots in between them. Let sear until browned, about 1–2 minutes, then start stirring and moving the vegetables around with a spatula until there are browned spots on them and they are crisp-tender. Drizzle the lemon juice over the vegetables and toss to mix. Keep warm.
- Toss the chicken slices with thyme and sage until well-coated. Spread the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet and place over medium-high heat. Place the chicken strips in the pan and let brown for about 2 minutes without moving, then turn the pieces and cook for about 1.5 minutes, until just browned and cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Deglaze the pan with chicken stock and tamari—bring to a boil, then pour over the wild rice.
- Divide the wild rice between two low bowls, then arrange half of the vegetables on each bowl and top with half the chicken. Sprinkle with scallions and serve immediately.

Eating meals in bowls is comforting and easy — and this one is based on nutty, nutritious wild rice. There’s a big difference between hand-harvested, true wild rice and cultivated wild rice, notably the cooking time, so read the label to see which kind you have.
