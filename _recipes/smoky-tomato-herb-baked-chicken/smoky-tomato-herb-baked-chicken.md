ingredients:
- Smoky Tomato Herb Baked Chicken:

- 2|  tablespoon  whole-wheat flour
- 2|  teaspoon  smoked paprika
- 1|  teaspoon  dried oregano
- 0.5|  teaspoon  sea salt  divided
- 0.5|  teaspoon  ground black pepper  divided
- 1|  bone-in, skinless chicken thighs  trimmed
- 2|  tablespoon  olive oil  divided
- baby potatoes  scrubbed and quartered
- 3|  cloves garlic  minced
- 2.5|  cup  no salt added tomato sauce
- 0.75|  teaspoon  crushed red pepper
- 2|  large red and/or yellow bell peppers  cut into 1/2-inch strips

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Mist a large roasting pan with cooking spray. In a wide, shallow dish, mix together flour, paprika, oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Dredge chicken in flour mixture, turning to coat and shaking off excess.
- In a large nonstick skillet on medium-high, heat 2 teaspoons of the oil. Add half of the chicken and cook, turning once, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to prepared roasting pan. Repeat with another 2 teaspoons of oil and remaining chicken.
- In a large bowl, toss together potatoes, 1 teaspoon oil and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Add to roasting pan, spreading around the chicken. Bake for 25 minutes.
- Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil on medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce, red pepper, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.
- Pour tomato sauce mixture over chicken and potatoes and top with bell peppers. Return to oven and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of chicken reads 165˚F (74°C) and potatoes and bell peppers are tender, about 20 minutes.
