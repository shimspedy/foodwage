ingredients:
- Salmon Cakes on Mixed Greens:

- 0.25|  rolled oats
- wild-caught sockeye salmon
- 1|  large egg white
- 2|  tsp  Dijon mustard
- 1|  tsp  dried dill
- 1|  tsp  fresh lemon zest
- 4|  cup  mixed greens
- 1|  medium cucumber, peeled and sliced
- 0.5|  cup  shredded carrot,
- 1|  tbsp  live oil
- 1|  tbsp  fresh lemon juice

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
- Place oats in a the bowl of a food processor and process until ground to the texture of coarse crumbs.
- On a cutting board, use a chef’s knife to skin the salmon. Divide the salmon in half and cut half in 0.5 inch slices. Place the slices in the food processor. Finely chop the remaining salmon and reserve. Pulse the food processor 3 or 4 times to puree the salmon into the oats. Add the egg white, Dijon, dill and lemon zest and pulse to mix, scraping with a spatula and repeating to make sure it’s all incorporated. Add the chopped salmon and pulse once to mix.
- Use a 0.25 cup measure to form patties, dividing the mixture into four even portions and place on the prepared pan. Use dampened palms to flatten to 0.75 inch (19mm) thick rounds. Bake for 10 minutes.
- Salmon cakes are done when firm when pressed and browned on the bottom; transfer to a plate.
- For the salad, place the greens, cucumber and carrot in a large bowl. In a jar or small bowl mix the oil and lemon juice. Pour over the greens and toss to coat.
- Divide the greens among four plates, and top each with a salmon cake.

A small fillet of wild-caught salmon stretches to serve four in the form of lovely little salmon cakes on a salad. Instead of breadcrumbs, you’ll bind them with a bit of whole-grain oats, and if you choose gluten-free oats, you can serve them to your gluten-avoiding friends and family.
