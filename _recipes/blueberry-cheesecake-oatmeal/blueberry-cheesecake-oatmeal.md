ingredients:
- Blueberry Cheesecake Oatmeal:

- cup  old-fashioned rolled oats  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 2|  teaspooon  baking powder
- 1|  teaspoon cinnamon
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 2  cup  frozen wild blueberries or 1 1/2 cups (150 grams) regular frozen blueberries
- 1.25|  cup  unsweetened vanilla almond milk
- 2|  eggs  lightly beaten
- 0.25|  cup  maple syrup
- 2|  teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
- 0.75|  cup  cottage cheese or Greek yogurt

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F (200°C). Coat a 9-by-13-inch (23×30 cm) baking dish with cooking spray/oil. (Use a smaller baking dish if you prefer a thicker oatmeal).
- Combine oats, baking powder, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the blueberries. (Coating them prevents the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the oatmeal.)
- Stir in the milk, eggs, vanilla, maple syrup and cottage cheese. Transfer oatmeal mixture to the prepared baking dish.
- Cover baking dish with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 15–20 minutes. Serve with fresh blueberries and a splash of milk.
