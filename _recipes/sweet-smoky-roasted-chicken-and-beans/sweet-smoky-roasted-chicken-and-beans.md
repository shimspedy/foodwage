servings: 4


ingredients:

- Olive oil cooking spray
- 1  teaspoon  raw honey
- 2.5|  teaspoon  safflower oil, divided

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil, and mist with cooking spray.
- In a small bowl, combine honey, 2 teaspoons oil, lime juice, 1/4 teaspoon chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper.
- Using paper towels, pat chicken dry and place on prepared sheet. Brush chicken evenly with honey mixture. Roast for about 30 to 35 minutes, turning over halfway until golden brown and chicken reaches 165°F when tested with an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part. Remove from oven, cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Using tongs, turn chicken to dip both sides in caramelized juices on sheet. (Alternatively, use a brush to brush on juices.)
- Meanwhile, in a medium-size saucepan on medium heat, heat remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil. Add onion, garlic, jalapeño, remaining 1/8 teaspoon chili powder and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Sauté until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste, and sauté for 1 minute. Add beans and broth, and bring to a simmer on medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 25 minutes more. Stir in lime zest and 2 tablespoons cilantro.
- Divide beans among shallow bowls, and top each serving with 1 piece of chicken. Drizzle any remaining juices from baking pan over chicken, and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon cilantro.

Sweet and spicy chicken tops saucy pinto beans in this easy recipe from Clean Eating. For a change, you can make this dish into a wrap—simply shred the chicken and serve it with the beans in warm whole-wheat tortillas.
