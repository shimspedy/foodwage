meal: breakfast
chef: foodwage
time: under 45 mins
servings: 2

notes:

ingredients:
- 2|  cup  cubed sweet potato
- 2|  cup  cubed beet
- 2|  tsp  dried sage
- 2|  teaspon  olive oil
- 2|  large  eggs  or veggie sausage patties
- 0.5|  tsp  freshly ground black pepper

directions:
- Set up a pot to steam in, and place the cubed sweet potatoes and beets in a steamer. Steam over simmering water for about 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl and let cool until they are no longer steaming.
- Stir the sage into the sweet potato mixture.
- In a large, nonstick or seasoned cast-iron skillet, drizzle the olive oil and place over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the sweet potato mixture and stir once or twice, for about 4 minutes. Spread the hot vegetables in the pan and press gently to make an even layer.
- Make an indentation in the vegetables on each side of the pan, and crack an egg into each indentation. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pan and cook, without disturbing, for about 4–5 minutes, until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny. If you want harder eggs, use a spatula to flip the egg and the beets under it and cook for a minute longer.
- If adding sausage, nestle a patty of sausage into the vegetables on each side of the pan, and cook until heated through.
- Serve immediately, with an optional dash of hot sauce.

Savory skillet breakfasts are the antidote to sugary pastries — and this one has no added sugar and gets its sweetness naturally from the sweet potato and beets. This veggie-packed plate keeps you full and energized all morning. Sauteing the steamed vegetable cubes gives them a crispy edge, reminiscent of hash browns, but they’re much better for you.
