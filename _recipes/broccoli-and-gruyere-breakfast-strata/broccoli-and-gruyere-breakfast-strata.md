ingredients:
- Broccoli and Gruyere Breakfast Strata:

- whole-grain crusty bread  ,cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  leek, white and light green parts  halved and thinly sliced
- 5|  cup  broccoli crowns  cut into 1 1/2-inch florets
- 6|  large eggs
- 0.5|  cup  2% milk
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  black pepper
- 0.5|  teaspoon  freshly grated nutmeg
- 0.75|  cup  grated Gruyere or Swiss cheese

directions:
- Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and bake while the oven is preheating for 10 minutes. Spray a 9-inch square baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange the bread in an even layer in the baking dish and set aside.
- In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and saute until tender, 3 minutes. Add the broccoli and 0.25 cup water, cover and simmer until broccoli is just crisp-tender, 4 minutes. Arrange the broccoli mixture over the bread in the baking dish.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt and nutmeg. Pour over the bread and broccoli mixture. Sprinkle with the cheese. Bake until a knife inserted into the center of the strata comes out clean, 45 minutes to an hour.
