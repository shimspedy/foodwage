notes:

ingredients:
- Vegetarian Quinoa Sushi:

- 4|  sushi nori seaweed sheets
- 0.5|  medium  cucumber
- 2|  medium  carrots
- 1|  medium  avocado
- 1|  cup  cooked quinoa certified gluten-free if necessary
- Low-sodium soy sauce  certified gluten-free if necessary; optional dipping sauce
- Sesame seeds  optional garnish
directions:
- Cut vegetables and avocado into long thin strips. For the carrots, I tried both a vegetable peeler and a cheese grater but I liked the cheese grater better.
- Place one seaweed sheet on a kitchen towel and spoon quinoa onto the sheet, leaving about an inch on the edge farthest from you and patting down the quinoa with the back of the spoon as you go.
- Place a few strips of the veggies and avocado on the edge closest to you on top of the quinoa.
- Slowly roll the nori sheet with the vegetables inside, using the towel to help you squeeze the sushi as you roll so that it keeps its shape and rolls tightly.
- When you reach the end of the sheet, dab some water onto the edge with your finger, finish rolling and squeeze the roll again.
- Repeat to make five total rolls and then cut into roll pieces using a sharp or serrated knife.
- Serve immediately with soy sauce and sesame seeds.
