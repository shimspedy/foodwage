ingredients:
- Quiche:

- 1| deep dish frozen pie shell  (9 inch wide)
- 5| ounces  bagged broccoli florets  (approx. 2 cups), coarsely chopped in food processor
- 0.5| cup chopped onion
- 3| tablespoons olive oil
- 0.5| teaspoon salt
- 0.5| teaspoon ground black pepper
- 0.5| teaspoon paprika

- 1| cup  shredded Parmesan-Romano-Asiago cheese blend  divided, (approx. 4 ounces)
- 3| large eggs

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F. Bake the pie shell for 8 minutes, occasionally pricking with a fork to deflate any air bubbles, or until lightly colored. Remove the shell and set aside.
- Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Meanwhile, in an 8 inch x 8 inch microwaveable baking dish, combine the broccoli, onion, oil, salt, pepper, and paprika. Cover with plastic wrap, leaving a small corner vent. Microwave on high power, stirring once, for 3 minutes, or until sizzling. Remove. Add the half-and-half, tomatoes, and 3/4 cup of the cheese. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating with a fork after each addition.
- Pour the filling into the reserved pie shell. Sprinkle with the remaining 0.25 cup of the cheese. Bake for about 35 minutes, or until set. Let stand for 15 minutes.
