Nachos are usually a dietary disaster, but they donâ€™t have to be. In this version, a base of oil-free baked chips cradles smoky, spicy black beans, creamy avocado and a tangy topping of Greek yogurt. Make them in the microwave, at home or at work, for an almost instant meal full of healthy fat and 17 grams of protein.
