directions:
- For the quinoa - In a small pot, bring the water to a boil, then add the quinoa, carrot and turmeric and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to low and cover the pot. Cook for 15 minutes, until the water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until ready to serve.
- For the soup - In a medium pot, pour the olive oil and place over medium-high heat. Add the onions and ginger and stir until they start to sizzle, about 1 minute. Lower the heat to medium-low and stir frequently for about 5 minutes. When the onions are soft and translucent, raise the heat to medium-high, add the spinach and stock and cover the pot for about 2 minutes. Remove the lid, stir and turn the spinach; it should be wilted and bright green.
- For the soup - Pour the almond milk into the blender, add the white miso and the spinach mixture. Secure the lid and blend until smooth. Return to the pot to reheat to your preference.
- Serve 1 cup soup in a wide bowl, and mound 0.5 cup of the warm quinoa mixture in the middle. Garnish with scallions and serve.

This non-dairy version of creamed spinach soup gets its creamy texture from miso and almond milk. The turmeric-tinted quinoa lends some texture and bite which makes this soup a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds. Itâ€™s a plant-based meal that really satisfies.
