It’s Meatless Monday, and these cheesy vegetarian enchiladas from The Honour System have us drooling. In this version, whole wheat tortillas are stuffed with a savory mixture of ricotta, spinach, garlic and brown rice. To kick up the flavor, they’re then topped with a spiced up cheddar cheese and salsa before baking. In one word, yum.
