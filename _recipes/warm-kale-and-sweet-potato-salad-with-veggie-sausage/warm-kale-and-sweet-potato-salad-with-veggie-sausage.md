ingredients:
- Salad:

- 2|  pieces  veggie sausage  1|
- 1|  cup  cubed sweet potato  4|
- 2|  tsp  ground sage  1|
- 1|  tsp  lemon juice
directions:
- Take out the frozen sausage patties and let them thaw while you prep the salad.
- Drizzle the olive oil in a large skillet and place over medium-high heat. Add the sweet potato cubes and stir until they start to sizzle. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan so the sweet potatoes steam. Cook for about 10 minutes, until they are tender when pierced with a paring knife.
- Uncover the pan and add the kale, stirring to coat with oil. Add the sage and stir until the kale turns dark green.
- Add the maple syrup and lemon juice and stir, just until the liquids coat the vegetables. Remove from heat and keep warm.

This savory-sweet kale salad is just as appropriate for breakfast as it is for lunch or dinner. Cut the sweet potato cubes into 1/2-inch (1.27cm) squares so they cook quickly. The bright orange cubes look brilliant next to the deep green kale, which makes it a feast for the eyes.
