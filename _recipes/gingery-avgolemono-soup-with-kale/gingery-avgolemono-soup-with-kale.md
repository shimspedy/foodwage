notes:


ingredients:
- Soup:

- 2|  Qts  Low-Sodium or Unsalted Chicken Stock  1.75| (5 thighs)
- 4|  Inches  Sliced Lengthwise Fresh Ginger  1
- 4|  Large Egg Yolks  0.33333333333|
- 2.5|  cups  Cooked White Rice  3|
- 0.5|  cup  Small Dill Sprigs

- Garnish:

- To Taste  Fresh Ground Pepper  6|

directions:
- In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the chicken stock, chicken thighs, ginger and garlic. Season with salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low and simmer until the chicken thighs are cooked through, about 30 minutes. Use a large spoon to skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
- Using tongs, transfer the chicken thighs to a work surface. When they are cool enough to handle, shred the meat. Discard the bones and skin.
- Meanwhile, strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve set over a large heatproof bowl; discard the solids. Transfer 1 cup (250ml) of the stock to a blender and return the remaining stock to the pot. Bring to a gentle simmer over moderately-low heat.
- Add the egg yolks, lemon juice and 1 cup (180g) of the cooked rice to the blender with the reserved stock. Puree until smooth. While stirring constantly, stream the puree into the simmering stock. Add the shredded chicken and the remaining 1.5 cups (270g) of rice. Cook, stirring, until the soup thickens, 5–7 minutes. If the soup starts to boil, reduce the heat to low. Add the kale and cook, stirring, until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in the dill. Season with salt and pepper and more lemon juice, if desired.
- Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with lemon wheels, freshly ground black pepper and more dill sprigs. Serve right away.

This rich, creamy soup is a take on the traditional Greek chicken and rice soup, avgolemono, but with added nutritious oomph from ginger, garlic, kale and extra lemon. It’s soothing and unctuous, but still good for you. The vitamin C-rich lemon and calming ginger also make this a cure-all remedy if you’re suffering from a winter cold.
Cooking tip: When it comes time to stir in the egg yolk-and-rice mixture that thickens the soup, be sure to keep the broth at a gentle simmer. If the soup comes to a boil, you risk curdling the eggs.
