ingredients:
Farro:

- 1| cup farro 1.66666666666|
- 4| baby carrots, quartered lengthwise 2|
- 0.25| cup frozen peas, thawed 2|
- 0.5| tsp salt 0.5|

Chicken:

- 1| lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast 1|

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF (205ºC). In a small pot, bring 3 cups water to a boil and add the farro. Place a lid, slightly ajar, on the pot, and reduce to a simmer for 25–45 minutes, depending on the type of farro. When the farro is tender, drain in a fine mesh strainer. Let cool.
- Place the chicken on a parchment-lined sheet pan and drizzle with a teaspoon of olive oil. Bake for 20–25 minutes, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160ºF (71ºC). Cool the pan on a rack, when cool enough to handle, shred and set aside.
- Set up a steamer and steam the carrot slices for 3 minutes, then place the asparagus on top of the carrots and steam 2 minutes longer. Drain and add to the farro with the peas, parsley and chicken.
- In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, salt, pepper and remaining olive oil and whisk to combine. Drizzle over the farro mixture and toss to coat.
- Makes 7 cups. Keeps for up to four days, tightly covered, in the refrigerator.

Farro is a deliciously hearty, filling whole grain. If you purchase whole farro, it takes 40 minutes or longer to cook. If you’re short on time, pearled (or perlato) farro has had some bran removed and cooks in about 20 minutes. Chicken breast adds protein and the asparagus and peas lighten up the dish for a high-protein, high-fiber meal.
