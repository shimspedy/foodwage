ingredients:
- Broccoli, Kale & Cheddar Quiche:

- 1|  cup  low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth  plus 2 tablespoons
- 0.66666666666|  cup  white quinoa  rinsed
- 1|  bay leaf
- 4|  large egg whites
- 3|  large eggs
- 0.5|  cup  shredded cheddar cheese  divided
- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  leek, white and light green parts only  halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
- 1|  cup  broccoli florets  cut in 1/4-inch pieces
- cup  packed Tuscan or lacinato kale  stems removed and chopped
- 0.5|  cup  whole milk
- 2|  teaspoon  Dijon mustard
- 0.5|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  black pepper

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F (191°C). Coat an 8-inch pie dish or quiche pan with cooking spray; set aside. (Note: Opt for a dish with a depth of about 1 1/2-inches.)
- In a small saucepan, combine broth, quinoa and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until quinoa is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; cool.
- Whisk 1 egg; stir into cooled quinoa. Mix in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of cheese. Press mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pie dish. Bake on a rimmed baking sheet until crust is dry to the touch, about 25 minutes.
- Meanwhile, in a skillet with a tight-fitting lid, heat oil on medium-low. Add leek and sauté, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add broccoli, kale and 1/4 cup water; cover and cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Drain and scrape into crust.
- In a small bowl, whisk together remaining 2 eggs, egg whites, milk, mustard, salt and pepper. Pour into crust and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup (60 ml) cheese. Bake on rimmed baking sheet until top is golden and a knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool completely. Cool completely and enjoy. To save for later, cut into six wedges, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 3–4 days. To serve, unwrap, transfer a slice to oven or toaster oven and heat at 350 °F until warm. Quiche can also be enjoyed cold.
