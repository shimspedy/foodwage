notes:

ingredients:
- Chicken & Brown Rice Bowl:

- 0.5|  cup  uncooked brown rice certified gluten-free if necessary
- uncooked, boneless, skinless chicken breast
- Dash salt
- Dash pepper
- 2|  tsp  olive oil  plus 2 tablespoons divided
- 1|  tbsp  honey
- 3|  tbsp  lemon juice about 1 medium lemon
- 1|  tsp  Dijon mustard
- 1|  tsp  Dijon mustard
- 0.75|  chopped celery  about 2 stalks
- 0.5|  cup  diced onion  about ½ small onion
- 1.5|  cup  frozen peas and carrots  thawed
- 0.25|  cup  chopped basil
directions:
- Cook brown rice according to package directions.
- To grill chicken, preheat grill to high. Place chicken breasts between two pieces of wax paper and, using a meat mallet, pound to 0.5-inch thickness. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and lightly rub with 2 teaspoons olive oil. To prevent sticking, lightly oil the grill grate before adding chicken. Cook chicken until firm to the touch, about 2-3 minutes per side. (Alternatively, you may bake or cook chicken in a skillet on the stovetop until firm and opaque throughout.)
- In a large bowl, whisk together remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, honey, lemon juice and Dijon mustard. Add celery, onion, peas and carrots, and brown rice; toss to coat. Divide rice mixture into 4 servings (about 0.75 cups rice mixture or 137 grams each). Top each with about 4 ounces grilled chicken. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
