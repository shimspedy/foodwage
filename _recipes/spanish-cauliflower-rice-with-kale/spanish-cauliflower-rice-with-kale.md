ingredients:
- Spanish Cauliflower Rice With Kale:

- 2|  tbsp  olive oil
- 1|  cauliflower head  grated
- 6|  garlic cloves  minced
- 1|  jalapeño  seeded and finely chopped
- 2|  cups  kale leaves  tightly packed
- 14.5|  oz  can diced tomatoes
- 1|  tsp  kosher salt  or to taste
- 1.5|  tbsp  chili powder
- Cherry or grape tomatoes  for serving, optional

directions:
- Remove the green stems from the cauliflower and chop the head in half. Using a box grater (or a food processor), grate the cauliflower.
- In a large skillet, heat the oil to medium-high and sauté the onion until fragrant and softened, about 5 minutes.
- Add the jalapeño and garlic and sauté another 2–3 minutes.
- Add the grated cauliflower and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to brown and cook down, about 5–8 minutes.
- Add the diced tomatoes, salt and chili powder and stir well to combine. Cook until much of the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
- Add the chopped kale leaves and stir them into the mixture well. Cook until they have turned bright green and have wilted, about 3 minutes. Top with tomatoes, if using.
- Serve cauliflower rice alongside your favorite entrée.

Cauliflower “rice” is having a moment thanks to its low-carb, high-fiber benefits, which makes this riff on vegetarian paella from The Roasted Root virtually guilt free. Use a box grater or a food processor to reduce the cauliflower to a rice-like consistency, and feel free to add your protein of choice. With 1 cup of kale per serving, you’ll get 684% of your daily value of vitamin K, 250% of vitamin A and 375% of vitamin C.
