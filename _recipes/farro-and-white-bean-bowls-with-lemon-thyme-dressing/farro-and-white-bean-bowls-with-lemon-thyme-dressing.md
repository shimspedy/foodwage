ingredients:
- Farro and White Bean Bowls With Lemon-Thyme Dressing:

- 1|  cup  farro
- 0.5|  cup  no-salt added vegetable stock
- 2|  tbsp  fresh thyme  chopped
- 0.25|  cup  fresh lemon juice
- 1|  tsp  cornstarch
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- canned navy beans  no-salt added, drained and rinsed
- 4|  cup  fresh spinach  chopped
- 1|  cup  shredded carrot
- 0.25|  cup  shredded Parmesan cheese
- 0.5|  tsp  black pepper

directions:
- Place the farro and 4 cups water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until your grain is tender. Whole farro will cook in 45–60 minutes. Drain and let cool.
- In a small saucepan, combine the stock and fresh thyme and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes. In a cup, whisk the lemon juice, cornstarch and salt. After simmering the thyme, whisk in the lemon juice mixture and stir until thickened and clear. Remove from heat and let cool completely.
- In a large bowl, place the farro and drizzle with half of the lemon-thyme mixture. Toss to coat, and portion into four bowls. Arrange the remaining beans, spinach, carrot and Parmesan on the bowls, and drizzle with the remaining lemon-thyme dressing. Sprinkle with cracked pepper and serve.

Farro is an ancient, Italian form of wheat, with a nutty flavor and a chewy texture. When you shop for farro, you might see both whole “Grano Entero” and pearled “Perlato” or “Semi-Perlato.” While whole farro takes longer to cook, it’s considered a whole grain, whereas pearled, which cooks in as little as 25 minutes, isn’t. Since the bran has been removed, it has less fiber and protein per serving. This dish can be served as a “bowl” with a farro base and toppings arranged on top or tossed to mix and served as a grain salad.
