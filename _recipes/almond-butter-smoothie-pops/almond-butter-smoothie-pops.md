directions:

We all love frozen treats, but your average popsicle is just sugar and water. Take pop-making into your own hands, and make these creamy delights. Yogurt and almond butter give these a filling boost of protein (substitute Greek yogurt for even more protein). Banana and a little maple syrup sweeten them just enough to please your palate. A handful of spinach blends into the background for a bit of fiber in your treats.
