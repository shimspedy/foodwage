Fish tacos are a fun summer food and easy to make at home. Here, instead of breaded and fried fish, keep it lean with tilapia or halibut and just a dab of olive oil. Juicy mango fills out the taco and a topper of smoky slaw makes it a meal. This is mild, so add a dash of your favorite hot sauce if you need some heat.
