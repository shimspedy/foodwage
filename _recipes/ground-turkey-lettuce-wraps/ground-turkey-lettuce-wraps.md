Lettuce wraps are an easy way to enjoy a low-carb meal. This recipe features lean ground turkey sauteed with zucchini and mushrooms served on butter lettuce leaves. You can make the lettuce wrap filling ahead of time, freeze it, then reheat and eat when you’re ready. If you’re packing lettuce wraps for lunch, make sure to store the lettuce leaves separately.
