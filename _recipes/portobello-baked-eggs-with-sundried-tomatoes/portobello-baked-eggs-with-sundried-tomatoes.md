time: under 20 mins
servings: 2

notes:
- Try to pick out portobellos with a wide lip to hold in the fillings.
- If your egg yolk breaks or runs slightly off the mushroom while cooking, just reduce cooking time by a few minutes to avoid overcooking the yolk.

ingredients:
- Portobello Baked Eggs:

- 2|  Portobello Mushroom Caps  3.5|″ in diameter
- 2|  tablespoons  Soft Goat Cheese
- 4|  sun-dried tomatoes  diced
- 2|  large eggs
- to taste  salt
- to taste  pepper
- to taste  basil  for garnish

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400F
- Remove the stems from the mushroom caps and scrape out the gills with a spoon. Spray both sides of the mushroom with cooking spray or a light brush of olive oil on a paper towel and set the mushrooms onto a baking sheet.
- Spread half of goat cheese, and sprinkle half of the sun-dried tomatos into each mushroom cap. Crack one egg into each, centering the yolk in the cavity where the stem was to prevent it from moving around.
- Carefully transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake until whites are cooked through and the eggs are done to your liking, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and top with basil before serving.
