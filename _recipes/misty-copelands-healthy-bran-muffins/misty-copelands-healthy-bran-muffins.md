ingredients:
- Misty Copeland’s Healthy Bran Muffins:

- 0.5|  cup  coconut flour
- 0.25|  cup  bran
- 0.5|  teaspoon  baking soda
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 6|  eggs
- 0.25|  cup  coconut oil
- 0.5|  cup  honey
- 0.25|  cup  unsweetened applesauce
- 1|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- Cooking spray

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F.
- In a small bowl, combine the flour, bran, baking soda and salt.
- In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Mix in the oil, honey, applesauce and vanilla. Add the flour mixture and mix well. Let sit for 5 minutes so that the coconut flour can absorb the liquid.
- Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray. Pour the batter into the muffin tins, filling each muffin tin 3/4 full. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until brown.
- Let the muffins cool before serving. Extra muffins can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.

From her book, “Ballerina Body,” Misty Copeland, the first African-American female principal dancer for American Ballet Theater, emphasizes her need to eat for energy. Not surprisingly, she approaches daily meals in the same way she approaches dancing. In the chapter entitled “Meal Choreography,” she breaks down meal-planning suggestions for 21 days. These healthy bran muffins are just one of her nutritious building blocks.

Along with oatmeal, muffins are my go-to morning meal. There’s something comforting and particularly satisfying about a luscious morning pastry, but the great thing about these particular muffins is that the bran is also really good for you, and the honey and applesauce give the muffins just enough sweetness.
