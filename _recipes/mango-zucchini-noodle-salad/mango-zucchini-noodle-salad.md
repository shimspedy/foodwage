ingredients:
- Salad:
- 10|  ounces  boneless, skinless chicken breasts  about 2 breasts
- 1.5| cups  low-sodium chicken broth
- 1|  clove garlic  thinly sliced
- 1.5| teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
- 0.5|  medium avocado  pitted and peeled
- 2.5| cups  frozen mango chunks  thawed
- 6|  tablespoons  loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves  divided
- 2|  tablespoons  fresh lime juice
- 1|  teaspoon  reduced-sodium soy sauce  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 0.25| teaspoon  Sriracha sauce
- 3|  large zucchini  ends trimmed
- 1|  large carrot  ends trimmed and peeled
- 0.25| cup  raw unsalted cashews
directions:
- In a small saucepan, place chicken in a single layer. Pour in broth, then add garlic and ginger. Cover and bring to a boil on medium-high. Reduce heat to a simmer, place cover on pan, and cook until chicken is no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, shred or chop.
- Meanwhile, increase heat to high, and boil broth mixture, uncovered, until liquid is reduced to 0.25 cup, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
- In a blender, combine avocado, mango, 4 tablespoons cilantro, lime juice, soy sauce, Sriracha and broth mixture; blend on high speed until creamy and smooth.
- Working with 1 piece at a time, place zucchini into a spiral slicer and turn crank to create long strands that resemble spaghetti noodles. Repeat with carrot. *Always read directions for your spiral slicer, as instructions may vary by brand.* If you donâ€™t have a spiralizer, you can make this salad by cutting the zucchini and carrots into really thin matchstick strips.
- In a large bowl, toss zucchini and carrot strands with mango mixture to coat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Add chicken to bowl, tossing to coat. Sprinkle with cashews and remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro.

Spirals of zucchini and carrot are a lighter and lower-carb alternative to grain-based noodles. In this Clean Eating recipe, zucchini and carrots are tossed with a spicy mango and avocado dressing, and topped with chicken and crunchy cashews.
