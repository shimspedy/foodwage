There are plenty of dairy-free products out there that can make great substitutes for the real thing, whether you’re allergic, following a vegan diet or just want to cut back on animal products.
But when it comes to recreating creamy, cheesy sauces, the best swap is actually this DIY cashew cream made with just two ingredients (plus salt and water). The cream is an alfredo-like pasta sauce all on its own, and a few spoonfuls can turn a bland, dairy-free risotto or polenta into something that’s more decadent than the real thing — yet still nutritious. Plus, because it’s made with shelf-stable ingredients, it will keep for weeks in an airtight container in the fridge or up to a month in the freezer.  4 WAYS TO COOK WITH CASHEW CREAM
