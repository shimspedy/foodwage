ingredients:
- Cinnamon Quinoa Breakfast Bowl:

- 1|  cup  uncooked quinoa
- 1|  cup  water
- 1|  cup  non-dairy milk
- 0.5|  teaspoon  cinnamon
- 0.5|  teaspoon  vanilla
- 0.25|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 2|  tablespoon  cacao nibs
- 2|  tablespoon  maple syrup or to taste
- 2|  cup  chopped fresh fruit bananas, pineapple, cantaloupe, blueberries, watermelon, honeydew or mango

directions:
- Rinse and drain quinoa.
- Place water, milk and quinoa in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, add cinnamon, vanilla and sea salt. Cover and cook for about 15 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed. Watch the pot carefully because it has a tendency to boil over. Remove from heat and let pot sit, covered for 2-3 minutes.
- Remove lid and fluff quinoa before portioning into two bowls. Top with cacao nibs, fresh fruit and a drizzle of maple syrup. You can also add additional milk if you want more moisture.
