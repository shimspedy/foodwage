notes:

ingredients:
- Chicken:

- 2| teaspoons coconut oil
- 0.5| large onion  diced
- 0.25| tsp  ground turmeric
- 2| tablespoons butter
- 2| cloves  garlic minced
- 1| tablespoon  curry powder
- 1| teaspoon cumin
- 0.25| teaspoon  ground ginger
- 0.25| teaspoon  cayenne pepper
- 0.5| tsp  sea salt
- 1| cup  1% milk
- 0.25| cup  plain Greek yogurt
- 1| cup  low sodium tomato sauce
- 2| chicken breasts  cut into cubes
- 1| cup  dry quinoa  (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 0.5| cup  fresh cilantro leaves  roughly chopped (optional)
directions:
- Heat coconut oil in a medium sized saucepan over medium low heat. Add in the diced onion and cook, stirring frequently until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the turmeric and stir for another minute. Add the garlic, butter and remaining spices to the pot and stir well. Cook this mixture for another 5 minutes. You need to stir this pretty much constantly so it does not burn.
- Pour in the milk, yogurt, and tomato sauce and give it all a good stir, then add in the cubes of chicken
- Stir everything well and let simmer over medium low heat for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the sauce to thicken up.
- Meanwhile, cook the quinoa according to the package instructions. Portion out the quinoa into four bowls and spoon the butter chicken on top. Garnish with fresh cilantro if desired.
