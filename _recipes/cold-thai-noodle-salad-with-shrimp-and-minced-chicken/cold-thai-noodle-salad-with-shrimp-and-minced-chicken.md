- Cold Thai Noodle Salad With Shrimp and Minced Chicken:

- bean thread noodles  soaked in hot water for 10 minutes
- 3|  dried shiitake mushrooms
- ground chicken or pork
- shrimp  peeled and deveined
- 1|  cup  cherry tomatoes  halved
- 3|  small  shallots  thinly sliced
- 0.5|  cup  fresh basil leaves  chopped
- 3|  tbsp  lime juice
- 2|  tablespoon  fish sauce
- 4|  medium  garlic cloves  finely chopped
- 1|  tsp  brown sugar
- 2|  ed Thai chili peppers or 1 medium serrano pepper, finely chopped
directions:
- In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil over high heat. Add the mushrooms, cover, and set aside for 20 minutes. Remove mushrooms from the pan, thinly slice the caps and discard the stems, set aside.
- Return the mushroom water to a boil over high heat. Add the ground chicken and simmer until just cooked through, 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or small, fine-mesh sieve to transfer the chicken to a large serving bowl. Add the shrimp to the simmering water and cook until curled and pink, 4 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the bowl with the chicken.
- Drain the the noodles and add them to the pot. Simmer until al dente, about 1 minute. Drain, reserving 0.25 cup (60ml) of the cooking liquid, set aside. Snip the noodles with clean scissors into 4-inch lengths and add to the bowl with the chicken and shrimp. Add the sliced mushrooms, tomatoes, celery, shallots and cilantro.
- In a small bowl, combine the reserved cooking liquid, lime juice, fish sauce, garlic, sugar and chili peppers, and stir to dissolve the sugar. Toss with the noodle mixture and serve at room temperature or cold.
