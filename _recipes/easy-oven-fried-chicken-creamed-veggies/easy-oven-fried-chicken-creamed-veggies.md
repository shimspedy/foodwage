notes:

ingredients:
- For the oven-fried chicken:

- 1|  large  egg
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 0.25|  tsp  black pepper
- 1|  cup  panko breadcrumbs
- 1|  tbsp  paprika
- boneless, skinless chicken breast

- For the creamed veggies:

- 2|  cloves  garlic  minced
- 0.5|  small onion  diced
- 2|  tbsp  butter  unsalted
- 1.5|  cup  corn kernels
- baby spinach
- 0.25|  cup  cream
- 0.25|  tsp  salt
- 0.5|  lime  juiced
directions:
- Heat oven to 375 degrees F or 190 degrees C.
- To prepare the breading station, whisk egg with salt and pepper and set aside. Then, combine panko breadcrumbs and paprika in a container with a lid or ziplock bag.
- Slice chicken breast into strips then season with salt and pepper, and tenderize by pricking with a fork.
- Dip chicken into the whisked egg and toss into panko mixture. Cover with lid or zip bag and shake until panko coats chicken. Brush sheet pan with some oil and spread chicken out onto sheet pan. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until chicken is cooked and golden.
- While chicken is baking, cook the creamed veggies. Heat a skillet or saute pan over medium-high heat. Add butter and then garlic and onions to melted butter with a sprinkle of salt. Saute until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.
- Fold in corn and peas, and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until everything is warmed through.
- Fold in spinach with cream, salt and pepper. Finish with lime juice, and season to taste with more salt and pepper as needed.
- Enjoy chicken with your buttered side! (If the chicken tastes a bit dry, just coat it in your side.)
