directions:
- Slice the cucumber lengthwise halfway through. Spiralize using a linguine blade. Pat the cucumber noodles with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture.

Who says salsa has to have perfectly diced ingredients? Not those of us who are “Inspiralized”! It’s time to transform your salsas by using cucumber “noodles.” Bring this fresh snack to a potluck, barbecue or sporting event, where you know healthy foods will be scarce. Not only is it fun to eat, but it’s also a conversation starter. (If you don’t have a spiralizer, slice your cucumber in half lengthwise and then into half-moons.)
