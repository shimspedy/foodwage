ingredients:
- For the brownies:

- 2|  large  beets  boiled and peeled
- 2|  large  eggs  or 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal bloomed in 4 tablespoons water
- 3|  tbsp  melted coconut oil
- 0.75|  cup  cocoa powder the higher the quality the better
- 0.25|  tbsp  sea salt
- 1|  tsp  pure vanilla extract
- 0.5|  heaping cup  organic cane sugar
- 0.5|  tsp  baking powder

- For the frosting:

- 0.5|  cup  unsweetened plain almond milk
- 0.25|  cup  vegan dark or semisweet chocolate  chopped
- 0.5|  cup  vegan butter  Miyokos or Earth Balance soy-free), softened and cut into tablespoon-sized slices
- 1.5|  cup  powdered sugar

directions:
- Quarter beets and transfer to food processor; process until pureed, scraping the sides down twice. (You should end up with roughly 1.25 r 1.5 cups of beet puree.)
- Whisk together the flaxseed meal and the water if using. If using eggs, beat lightly and set aside.
- Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 9-by-9-inch brownie pan with parchment paper. Grease lightly with coconut oil.
- Add the eggs or flaxseed, coconut oil, cocoa powder, sea salt, vanilla, sugar and baking powder in the bowl of the food processor with the beets until smooth (roughly 3 minutes.) Scrape down the sides as needed until you have a well-combined batter.
- Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and bake 25–30 minutes, depending on how you like your brownies. For gooey brownies, bake until the top of the brownie is dry and the sides begin to pull away from the pan. For cakey brownies, bake until a skewer inserted in the middle of the brownies comes out with just a few moist crumbs. Then, remove from oven and allow to cool before removing from the pan. In the meantime, prepare the ganache.
- For the frosting - Warm the almond milk over medium-low heat until barely simmering, then transfer to a mixing bowl. (This can also be done in the microwave.) Immediately add chocolate to warm milk. Allow to melt for 2 minutes without stirring. Then, gently stir with a wooden spoon or spatula to incorporate. Add the softened vegan butter and cover. Let rest untouched for another 10 minutes so the mixture comes together.
- For the frosting - In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the ganache together so it incorporates. Add 1 cup of powdered sugar, then place in the fridge to set for 20–30 minutes. (You’ll know it’s ready when it moves slowly if the bowl is tipped.) Remove the frosting from the fridge and beat again. If it’s still too thin, add another 0.25| cup powdered sugar at a time and beat until light and fluffy. Spread on cooled brownies and enjoy!.

What’s not to love about a brownie, whether cakey, gooey, studded with nuts and chips or slathered in frosting? But when a brownie is better for you, there’s even more to love! These brownies incorporate healthy, mineral- and nutrient-rich beets into the batter so the goodness is baked in. Coconut oil stands in for butter, and you can even make them vegan by adding flaxseed instead of eggs, boosting the protein power.
Then, spread an easy vegan chocolate ganache over the top and wham — a better for you brownie, packed with ingredients that will make your brain and body feel good.
