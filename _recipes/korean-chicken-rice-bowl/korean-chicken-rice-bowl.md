ingredients:
- Korean Chicken Rice Bowl:

- 1|  cup  brown rice
- boneless skinless chicken breast
- 1|  tablespoon  soy sauce
- 1|  tablespoon  gochujung or other chili sauce  plus more for serving
- 1|  tablespoon  toasted sesame oil  divided
- baby kale
- 1|  green onion  finely chopped
- 1|  teaspoon  salt
- 1|  teaspoon  sesame seeds
- 1|  cup  kimchi

directions:
- In a medium saucepan, bring rice and 2 1/2 cups water to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. Cook 40 minutes, remove from heat and let sit 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
- Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine chicken, soy sauce, gochujung and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Toss to coat the chicken and set aside.
- Set a large frying pan over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup water along with baby kale, cover, reduce heat to low and cook until kale is tender and wilted, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold running water until cool. Squeeze small handfuls to remove as much liquid as possible from the kale. Transfer to a medium bowl and fluff apart with your fingers. Add half the green onion, salt, remaining 2 teaspoons sesame oil and sesame seeds. Toss to combine and set aside.
- Heat a large, nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Coat with cooking spray and add the chicken. Let cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook until brown on the second side and cooked through, about 5 more minutes depending on thickness. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.
- Divide rice between 4 serving bowls. Top each bowl with 1/4 kale salad and kimchi. Slice chicken and add to bowls. Garnish with remaining green onion and serve with additional chili sauce to taste.

Brown rice adds filling fiber, while marinated chicken brings tons of flavor and is served alongside gut-healthy, fermented kimchi. The simple sesame baby kale salad ensures you get your veggies. We call that a win-win.
