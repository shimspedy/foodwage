ingredients:
- Eggplant Lasagna Rolls:

- 2|  medium  eggplants, cut into 6-8 slices
- 1|  container low-fat ricotta cheese  15 ounces or 425 grams
- 1|  large  egg
- 1|  cup  chopped spinach leaves
- 10 to 12|  fresh basil leaves, chopped
- clove garlic, minced
- 2|  cup  shredded part skim, low-moisture mozzarella cheese
- 1|  can tomato sauce  15 ounces or 460 grams
- Salt and Ground Black Pepper  to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped  optional

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C).
- To slice the eggplants, chop the top and bottom ends off, and slice into 6-8 pieces lengthwise. Add the slices to a colander, and generously sprinkle with salt. Set aside for about 15 minutes or until the slices start to “sweat”. (Little droplets will form along the cut surfaces of the eggplant slices.)
- Rinse the eggplant slices well, and pat dry with a paper towel. Arrange in a single layer on a cookie sheet, and generously spray with cooking oil. Flip the slices, and add oil to the other side. Bake for about 12 minutes or until slices are just beginning to get slightly browned. Remove from the oven and set a side to cool.
- As the eggplant slices bake, make the cheese filling by combining the ricotta, spinach, egg, basil, garlic and 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese together in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and stir to combine.
- When the eggplant slices are cool enough to handle, you are ready to make your rolls. Spread 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce evenly along the bottom of a 9-inch by 13-inch baking dish.
- Take a slice of eggplant, and add about 2-3 tablespoons of cheese filling to the center of the slice. Roll into a burrito shape so that the two ends fold over each other, and place end side down into your prepared baking dish. Continue rolling the eggplant slices until you’ve used up your cheese and eggplant slices.
- Spoon the rest of the tomato sauce along the tops of the eggplant rolls in your pan. Top evenly with the rest of your mozzarella cheese.
- Bake for 20-30 minutes or until cheese is melted and sauce in the bottom of the pan is bubbly.
-   Serve with chopped fresh parsley.
