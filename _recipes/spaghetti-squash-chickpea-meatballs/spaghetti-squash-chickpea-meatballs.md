ingredients:
- Spaghetti Squash & Chickpea Meatballs:

- 1|  large  spaghetti squash
- 4|  tablespoon  olive oil  divided
- 4|  cloves garlic,  minced
- 0.25|  cup  chopped sweet onion
- 1|  large  egg  beaten
- 0.5|  cup  nutritional yeast
- 0.25|  cup  rolled oats  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 0.33333333333|  cup  hemp seeds  or flaxseed
- 0.5|  cup  chopped walnuts
- 0.5|  cup  fresh basil  chopped
- 0.25|  cup  dry sun-dried tomatoes  chopped
- 0.5|  teaspoon  dried oregano
- Pinch of red pepper flakes  to taste
- 0.5|  teaspoon  sea salt  to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper  to taste
- 1|  can  chickpeas  drained, rinsed and dried - certified gluten-free if necessary
- Marinara sauce and fresh basil leaves  optional garnish

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F. Using a sharp knife, poke holes all around the entire spaghetti squash. Place the squash directly on the rack of your preheated oven and cook for 45 minutes or until a knife easily goes through the skin. Take out of the oven and slice the squash in half, longways, be careful it’s hot! Scoop the seeds and center out, discard or roast the seeds as an option. Using a fork, gently scrape the sides of the squash until all the flesh is in ribbons. Set aside.
- In a medium heated skillet, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and onion. Sauté for 2-4 minutes until they start to soften; add minced garlic with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Continue to cook for about 5 minutes until fragrant.
- In a food processor or blender, combine the sautéed onions and garlic with nutritional yeast, oats, hemp seeds, chopped walnuts, basil, sun dried tomatoes, oregano, sea salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, remaining olive oil (2 tablespoons), and chickpeas. Pulse together until the mixture comes.
- Pour this mixture out into a large mixing bowl. Adjust seasonings to taste before you start rolling these into about 1 tablespoon balls. Use a little olive oil or water to coat your hands to prevent the chickpea meatballs from sticking, repeat until all of the batter are in balls.
- Using the same skillet you sautéed onions in, add in 1 tablespoon olive oil just to cover the bottom of the pan, add chickpea meatballs to cover the bottom and cook on medium until the outside is golden brown, about 5 minutes each side. Be gentle when flipping over each chickpea meatball so it doesn’t lose form. Use a baking sheet with parchment and paper towels to drain any excess oil
- To serve: Spoon out spaghetti squash noodles and chickpea meatballs evenly onto 4 plates. If desired, top with your favorite heated marinara sauce and fresh torn basil.
