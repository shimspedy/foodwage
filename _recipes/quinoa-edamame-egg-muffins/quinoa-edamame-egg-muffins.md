ingredients:
- Muffins:

- 0.25|  cup  quinoa  2|
- 6|  large egg whites  5.3|
- 2|  tbsp  shredded Parmesan cheese  2|
- 1|  cup  edamame, thawed and shelled

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC). Line eight cups in a muffin pan with paper liners and set aside.
- In a small pot, bring 0.5 cup water to a boil. Add the quinoa, cover tightly and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 14 minutes, then remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. The water should all be absorbed; let cool.
- In a large bowl, combine the eggs, egg whites and whisk until mixed. Add the yogurt and parmesan and whisk until smooth. Stir in the parsley, edamame and cooked quinoa.
- Divide the egg mixture between the prepared muffin cups, filling almost to the top
- Bake for 30 minutes, until puffed and firm to the touch. Cool in pan on a rack. Serve warm. To save for the week, let cool completely to room temperature before transferring to a storage container and covering tightly. Refrigerate for up to four days.

Make these high-protein, pre-portioned bakes to grab and go on a busy morning. Edamame and quinoa are plant-based all-stars, with lots of fiber and nutrients, and they give the eggy rounds some crunch and color.
