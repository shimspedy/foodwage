ingredients:
- Slow Cooker Chicken Chili:

- 2|  tbsp  olive oil
- 1|  large yellow onion  diced
- 5|  large garlic cloves  minced
- 1|  jalepeno seeded, and finely chopped
- 1| lb  boneless skinless chicken breast
- 8|  oz  caned green chilies  undrained
- 1|  quart  low-sodium chicken broth
- 1.5|  tsp  ground cumin
- 1|  tsp  dried parsley
- 1|  tsp  dried chives
- 0.5|  tsp  dried thyme
- 1.5|  tsp  sea salt  or more to taste

directions:
- In a medium skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high and add the onion. Saute, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, about 10â€“15 minutes. Add the garlic and jalapeno and continue cooking for 3 minutes.
- Transfer the onion-garlic-jalapeno mixture to your slow cooker (I used a 6-quart slow cooker), along with the rest of the ingredients. Stir well and cover. Cook on low for 8 hours.
- Use a fork to fish out the chicken breasts and place them on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the chicken, then place it back in the crock pot. If time allows, let the chicken soak in the chili for at least 1 hour (overnight is better) for maximum flavor.
- Serve heaping bowls of chili with your favorite toppings.
