notes:

ingredients:
- Kale Salad:

- 1| bunch  Kale  de-stemmed and chopped (about 4 cups)
- 2| tablespoons Tahini
- 2| tablespoons Apple Cider Vinegar
- 2| tablespoons fresh Lemon Juice
- 2| tablespoons Liquid Aminos  or Tamari (can be found at specialty grocers)
- 4| tablespoons Nutritional Yeast
- 2| teaspoons Garlic  minced

directions:
- Break or cut kale into bite size pieces and place in a large bowl.
- Puree all ingredients except kale in a blender or food processor to blend the dressing.
- Pour dressing over kale and massage into the kale with your hands until all pieces of kale are coated.
- Let the salad sit in the fridge for an hour or so to marinate. You can skip this step if you need to eat right away, but allowing some time to marinate will wilt the kale a bit and make it a little more palatable.
