The Golden Milk Latte has been called the “drink of the year,” buzzing all about the hip cafés of Los Angeles and New York. But what’s so ‘golden’ about this golden drink? It turns out, quite a bit.
The magic ingredient is an Indian spice called turmeric, touted for centuries as a silver bullet that cures all ailments. People from many cultures have consumed turmeric to reap the benefits of the curcumin it contains to cure colds, fight disease, settle stomachs and promote wellness. Most recently, turmeric is recognized for fighting inflammation which is as good a reason as any to stir up a cup of your own.
f you’re new to considering how herbs and spices impact your body beyond your tastebuds, this drink is a delicious way to kick open the door to wellness. Our recipe calls for cinnamon, which helps cleanse the body, ginger, which soothes the digestive system and eases stress, and coconut milk as well as black pepper, which help the body absorb the nutritional benefits of the herbs.
To make this comforting drink, we suggest using freshly ground cinnamon and fresh turmeric because it adds a clean, bright flavor to the latte. Dried turmeric can be substituted when fresh is not available. Keep in mind dried turmeric will settle at the bottom of the mug, so stir well before drinking.
