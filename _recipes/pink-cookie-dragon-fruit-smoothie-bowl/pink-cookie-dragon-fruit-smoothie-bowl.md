This creamy smoothie recipe from Hummusapien features tropical dragon fruit, also called pitaya, which you can find at Whole Foods. It’s an excellent source of vitamin C, magnesium, fiber and antioxidants. Combined with chocolate-flavored protein powder and almond milk, it makes for a sweet-savory breakfast bowl that is great post-workout. Adding crumbled chocolate chip cookies is optional … if you want it to be.
