ingredients:
- Potato Crusted Quiche:

- 1.5|  cup  potatoes  2 medium , peeled and shredded
- tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  small  onion  chopped

- 2|  cup  baby kale, spinach and Swiss chard

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F.
- Coat an 8-inch cast-iron skillet with cooking spray, and set aside.

- Bake for 15 minutes, until the edges turn light brown.
- Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a pan set over medium heat. Add the onions, and cook until translucent. Then add the tomatoes and mixed greens, and cook for a minute or two until the greens reduce.
- Transfer the cooked vegetables to a large bowl, and add the cheddar cheese, salt, pepper and eggs. Stir to combine.
- Reduce oven to 350°F.
- Pour the egg mixture over the potato crust. Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until eggs are set.
