notes:

ingredients:
- Pappardelle:

- 1|  small butternut (winter) squash  (about 1.5 pounds), peeled & cubed
- 1|  medium onions sliced,(about 4 ounces)
- 4| tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
- 3| tablespoons  maple syrup
- 2| tablespoons  olive oil
- 0.66666666666| pound  pappardelle  (or linguine or fettuccine)
- 2| tablespoons  butter
- 0.25| cup  pine nuts
- 0.25|  cup  freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano  about 1 ounce

directions:
- To roast the butternut squash, start by preheating the oven to 425 degrees. Mix together 2 tablespoons each of balsamic vinegar, maple syrup and olive oil. Toss with cubed butternut squash directly on a sheet pan. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes until golden on the outside or tender. (Can be done up to 5 days ahead)
- Bring a saucepan of water to a boil and add pasta. Cook according to package instructions. Before draining, save 1 cup pasta water.
- Heat a sauté pan over medium heat and add butter. Once melted, add onion. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes and then add 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of maple syrup. Sauté for another 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add in pasta and toss with reserved pasta water. The starch from the pasta water will create a nice sauce. Add in pine nuts, roasted butternut squash, and parmesan. Cook until everything is warmed through
