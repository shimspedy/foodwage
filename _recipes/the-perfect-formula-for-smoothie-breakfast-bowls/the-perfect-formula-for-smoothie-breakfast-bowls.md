At home, yogurt, granola and fruit is a pretty pedestrian breakfast. But if you’ve ever had an acai bowl for breakfast, you know that “ho-hum” breakfast is next level when it’s topped with fresh fruit and crunchy nuts and seeds. There’s just something delicious and decadent about a smoothie bowl for breakfast.

You can recreate the magic of this tropical treat at home (it’s shockingly easy!). It’s a pretty straightforward formula that can be flexible and leads to a refreshing, healthy and flavorful breakfast.
