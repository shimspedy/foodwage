The secret to creating a tender kale salad out of those sturdy, tough leaves is literally at your fingertips! Get up close and personal by using your hands to “massage” the leaves until they darken. Our zesty kale salad uses sweet orange juice and a touch of vinegar to brighten the kale and relax it even further. For a complete meal, enjoy the salad with a serving of fish or chicken.
