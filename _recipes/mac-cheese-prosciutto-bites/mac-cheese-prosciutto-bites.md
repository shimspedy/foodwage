notes:


ingredients:
- Mac & Cheese Prosciutto Bites:

- thinly sliced prosciutto  8–12 ounces
- elbow macaroni
- 2|  tablespoon  butter
- 0.33333333333|  cup  panko Japanese breadcrumbs
- 1.25|  cup  lowfat milk
- 1.5|  tablespoon  all-purpose flour
- 1.5|  cup  shredded Gruyère cheese
- 0.75|  cup  shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese
- Salt and pepper
- 3|  tablespoon  chopped fresh chives

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Flip over a 24-cup mini muffin pan. Coat the surface with cooking spray. (You can also use a regular 12-cup muffin pan.)
- Slice the prosciutto into thirds, and tightly cover each of the muffin molds. (If the prosciutto pieces tear, that’s OK.) Bake for 10–15 minutes, until the prosciutto has tightened up and become crispy. The prosciutto will shrink after baking but will still hold a good amount of macaroni and cheese. (Feel free to drain some of the grease from the baked prosciutto by placing them over a paper towel.)
- While the prosciutto is baking, cook the macaroni according to package instructions, then drain and set aside.
- In a small saucepan, heat the butter. When it is melted, add the panko and stir until well-incorporated. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook the panko for a few more minutes, until golden brown. Set aside.
- In another small saucepan, heat the milk over medium-high until small bubbles form. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Whisk in the flour, making sure to stir constantly to prevent it from clumping up too much. Mix in the cheese, salt and pepper, and turn off the heat. Fold in the cooked pasta, then stir in the chives. Let the mac and cheese cool for at least 5 minutes.
- To assemble, spoon some mac and cheese into one of the prosciutto cups, and sprinkle on some of the prepared panko.
- Serve immediately.
