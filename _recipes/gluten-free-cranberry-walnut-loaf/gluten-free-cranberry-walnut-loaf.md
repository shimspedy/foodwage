- In a bowl combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl combine almond milk, coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract and eggs. (Optional: If desired, you can add 0.25 cup of coconut palm sugar or brown sugar to offset the tartness of fresh cranberries.)

Crunchy walnuts and fresh cranberries unite in this bread by the Healthy Maven. The recipe is for a gluten-free version, but if you’d rather make it with whole wheat flour, that’ll work, too. Serve warm with a pat of butter or spoonful of jam for a delicious breakfast.
