servings: 3

notes:
- If you prefer softer, chewier apple chips, reduce the baking time and pull them out when they have reached your desired consistency.
- Store chips in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week. Keep the extra spice blend in an airtight container, as well, and use it in your favorite fall recipes.

ingredients:
- Pumpkin-Spiced Apple Chips:

- 3|  medium  Fuji apples
- 2|  tablespoons  ground cinnamon
- 1|  tablespoon  ground ginger
- 1.5|  teaspoon  ground nutmeg
- 1.5|  teaspoons ground cloves

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 200°F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Wash and core the apples (although if you prefer larger apple chips, slice the apple with its core intact and pick out the seeds as necessary). Using a mandoline, thinly slice the apples into rounds, discarding the bottom slice. Place the rounds on the baking sheet.
- Mix the spices together in a small bowl or jar. Lightly sprinkle over the apples, using a small spice shaker or your fingertips. The farther away you are from the apples, the lighter and more evenly spread the dusting will be.
- Bake the chips for 11/2 hours. Remove from the oven, carefully flip the chips with your fingers or a spatula, and sprinkle the new sides with spice blend. Put the chips back in the oven for another hour. When the hour is up, check on the chips. If they are about as crispy as you want them, turn the oven off and keep the chips in the oven as it cools down. This will allow them to reach maximum crunchiness.
