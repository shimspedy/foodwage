- 1|  tablespoon  Olive Oil
- 1|  teaspoon  Chili Powder

- 1|  Pinch  Brown Sugar

directions:
- Preheat oven to 450ºF (230ºC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. In a medium-sized bowl, toss all the ingredients for the roasted chickpeas together. Pour the chickpeas onto the lined baking sheet and bake for about 20-22 minutes, giving them a quick toss after 12 minutes. Once they look browned and shriveled, they are ready to take out of the oven.
- While the chickpeas roast, divide cauliflower into chunks and, in batches, pulse in a food processor (or grate by hand) until it has a the consistency of rice.
- Heat a sauté pan with remaining olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic, stir, and as soon as it begins to brown add the zucchini, bell pepper and saute for 2-3 minutes. Add corn kernels and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Finally, add the cauliflower, spices (chili powder, cayenne pepper, ground cumin, salt) and cook for 2-3 more minutes until just tender.
- Transfer veggie mixture to a large serving bowl. Gently mix in the lemon juice, chickpeas and chopped tomatoes. Top with cilantro and/or sliced avocado if you like.
