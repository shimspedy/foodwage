notes:
- Air Fryer Instructions Place in Air fryer, with space in between for about 10 minutes at 390°. Check them, and if the bacon is not done, continue cooking for 2 minutes until the desired doneness.
- Oven Instructions Preheat oven to 400° Place on a baking sheet about 2 " apart. Bake for 15 minutes, then check the doneness of the bacon. Remove when golden brown and crisp.

ingredients:
- 12| small peppers, assorted colors
- 0.3| cup cream cheese
- 0.25| cup cheddar cheese
- 6| pieces of bacon

directions:
- Rinse peppers, cut of tops then cut in half lengthwise.

- Mix cream cheese and cheddar cheese until well blended.
- Roll cheese mixture into nickel size balls, set aside.
- Roll each piece of bacon to almost double its size.
- Cut bacon in half both lengthwise and then cut that in half width-wise. Each piece of  bacon will give you 4 pieces of bacon for 4 different peppers.
- Place cheese ball into pepper half and press the cheese into all parts of the pepper.
- Then wrap one piece of bacon around the pepper.
- Allow to chill for 15 minutes minimum *if you are making ahead, make to here then place in a sealed container until ready to cook.*
- Grill at medium heat while watching the entire time, about 15-20 minutes. You must watch the entire time and make sure the grill doesn't flame up and burn them. Move them around to avoid any hot spots. Grill until bacon is crisped and browned and cheese is melty. *see notes for AIr Fryer and Oven instructions*
