servings: 4

notes:

- 
ingredients:
- Cauliflower:

- 0.5| large cauliflower head 7-inch (18cm) diameter
- 1| tsp olive oil
- 1| cup red bell pepper chopped
- 1| cup onion chopped
- 2| tablespoons dry white wine
- 0.125| teaspoon saffron crumbled
- 0.5| teaspoon smoked paprika
- 0.5| cup edamame shelled
- 0.5| cup fresh parsley chopped

- Shrimp:

- 2| tsp olive oil
- 8| ounces large shrimp about 16|

directions:
- Trim the base of the cauliflower, and cut the florets and stems into 1.5|-inch (3.75cm) chunks. Place about half the cauliflower into the bowl of a food processor and pulse, chopping to the size of rice. Scrape into a bowl and repeat with the remaining cauliflower. Reserve.
- In a large saute pan, drizzle 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Place over medium-high heat for a few seconds before adding the cauliflower, pepper and onion. Stir to saute for about 2 minutes. Add the wine, saffron and paprika and stir, cover the pan and bring to a boil, cook for about 6 minutes to soften the vegetables. Remove the lid and stir in the edamame, cooking until the pan is nearly dry. Keep warm, and stir in the parsley just before serving.
- For the shrimp, place a large saute pan over high heat and drizzle with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil. Place the shrimp in the pan and when they start to sizzle, lower the heat to medium. Cook the shrimp for about 2–3 minutes per side, turning with a spatula.

This low-carb version of paella is quick and easy, unlike the original. The cauliflower “rice” takes on a golden glow, thanks to saffron, and the dish gets a bit of smoky flavor from the paprika. A crown of seared shrimp makes it irresistible
