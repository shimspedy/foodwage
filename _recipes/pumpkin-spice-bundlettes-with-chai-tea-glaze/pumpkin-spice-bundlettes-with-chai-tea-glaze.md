ingredients:
- For the cakes:

- 1.75|  cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
- 2|  tsp  baking soda
- 2|  tsp  pumpkin pie spice
- 0.5|  tsp  ground cardamom
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 0.5|  cup  brown sugar  packed
- 0.25|  cup  unsalted butter  room temperature
- 1|  large  egg
- 1|  cup  pumpkin puree  not pumpkin pie filling
- 0.25|  cup  maple syrup
- 1|  tsp  vanilla extract

- For the glaze:

- 0.5|  cup  powdered sugar
- 1  tsp  strong chai tea

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F (177ºC). Coat a 12-well mini Bundt cake pan well with cooking spray and set aside. (Use a muffin tin if you don’t have a mini Bundt pan.)
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, cardamom and salt. In a large bowl, beat the brown sugar and butter on medium-high until light and fluffy, 3 minutes. Add the egg and beat to combine. Add the pumpkin, maple syrup and vanilla, stirring to combine.
- Fold the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture with a rubber spatula until just combined and no traces of flour are left. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean, 18–20 minutes. Place the pan on a cooling rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from pan and set flat side down on a serving tray to cool completely.
- Sift the confectioner’s sugar into a small bowl. Add the chai tea and stir until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the cakes and let them sit at room temperature until the glaze has set. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.

These not-too-sweet pumpkin mini Bundt cakes feature toasty spices and a chai tea glaze, the perfect treat with a cozy cup of tea. The whole-grain flour and pumpkin add fiber.

Cooking tip: If you don’t have a mini (12-well) Bundt pan, bake the batter in a muffin tin, and you’ll still reap the portion-friendly sizing.
