ingredients:
- Skillet Spanish Chicken & Rice:

- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 4|  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  black pepper
- 1|  tablespoon  minced garlic
- 1|  small  onion  diced
- 1|  medium  green bell pepper  diced
- 1.33333333333|  cup  instant brown rice  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 1|  quater  canned tomatoes with liquid
- 2|  teaspoon  chili powder
- 2|  teaspoon  ground cumin
- 0.25|  cup  pitted and sliced green olives
- 0.25|  cup  fresh cilantro leaves
- 0.25|  cup  crumbled queso fresco

directions:
- In a large skillet, heat oil on medium-high. Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Transfer to skillet, and sauté until lightly browned, 4–5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm.
- Add garlic and onion to skillet, and sauté for 1 minute. Add bell pepper, and sauté for 2 more minutes. Add rice, and stir until lightly toasted and combined with vegetables.
- Add tomatoes with liquid, chili powder and cumin to skillet and stir to combine. Using the edge of a wooden spoon, break apart any larger tomato pieces. (If rice is not covered by tomato liquid, add an additional 1/4 cup or 60ml water.) Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer.
- Place chicken on top of tomato-rice mixture. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Turn off heat, and let sit on stovetop, covered, for 5 minutes.
- Add olives and cilantro to chicken-rice mixture, and toss and fluff with a fork. (If desired, remove chicken to ease stirring, then return to skillet.) To serve, sprinkle queso fresco over top of chicken-rice mixture and divide evenly among serving plates.

Canned tomatoes and instant brown rice make this cozy chicken skillet from Clean Eating a breeze, with just 20 minutes of prep. To top it off, this warming Spanish dinner is packed with bell peppers and olives for an aromatic meal you won’t forget! (Queso fresco is a salty, creamy Mexican cheese that is often used for garnish in Mexican dishes. If you can’t find it, swap in feta.)
