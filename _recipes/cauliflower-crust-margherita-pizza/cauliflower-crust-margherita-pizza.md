notes:


ingredients:
- Cauliflower-Crust Margherita Pizza:

- 1|  ecipe cauliflower pizza crust  baked
- 2|  cup  tomato sauce
- fresh mozzarella cheese  cut into 4–6 slices cut into 4–6 slices
- 6|  fresh basil leaves
- 2|  teaspoon  olive oil  optional

directions:
- Arrange a rack in the top 1/3 of the oven. Preheat oven to 400°F.
- Spoon on the tomato sauce and spread over the crust (the back of a spoon is a good tool for spreading). This may not seem like a lot, but beware, too much sauce turns the tender crust soggy.
- Arrange the cheese evenly around the pizza. Add the basil leaves.
- Bake until cheese melts and crust edges brown, 8–10 minutes.
- Drizzle with olive oil, if you like. Cut into 6 slices and serve hot

Classic Neapolitan toppings on a 21st-century crust: It’s pizza you can dig into while meeting your nutrition goals. The cauliflower crust is fully baked before toppings are added. Make the “dough” up to a day ahead for an easy weeknight dinner.
