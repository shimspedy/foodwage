notes:


ingredients:
- Dry ingredients:

- 2|  cup  gluten-free rolled oats  plus 1/4 cup (22.5g)
- 0.5|  cup  pecans
- 0.5|  cup  maca maple cashews
- 0.5|  cup  flaked unsweetened coconut
- 3|  tbsp  sunflower seeds
- 3|  tbsp  sesame seeds
- 2|  tbsp  chia seeds
- 1|  tsp  cinnamon
- Pinch of sea salt

- Wet ingredients:

- 0.5|  cup  brown rice syrup
- 1|  tbsp  maple syrup
- 0.33333333333|  cup  natural organic almond butter
- 1|  tsp  vanilla
- 1|  cup  dark chocolate  broken into pieces

directions:
- Line an 8-by-8-inch pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking, and let the parchment hang over the edges so you can use it as handles later. Set aside.
- In a large bowl, combine all the dry ingredients. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, stir together the brown rice syrup, maple syrup and almond butter until warm and smooth. Once the consistency of the wet mixture is thin, remove from heat and stir in the vanilla.
- Pour the wet ingredients into bowl full of dry ingredients, stirring well to incorporate and coat as much of the dry ingredients as possible.
- Press the granola into the lined baking pan in an even layer, spreading it into all four corners. (Tip: Use the back of a spatula to ensure the layer is as smooth and flat as possible.)
- Set the pan in the freezer for 2–3 hours to allow the dough to firm up. (They’re easiest to cut when they’re semi/mostly frozen.) Then slice into 10 bars with a sharp knife. Melt the chocolate on the stove using a double boiler. Drizzle over the trail mix bars and freeze again for about 15 minutes or until chocolate is fully set.

These homemade trail mix bars are a good for you on-the-go snack. They’re packed with healthy fats thanks to the nuts, and the oats add plenty of fiber to keep you feeling full. Try them on a nice fall hike or when you’re looking for a healthier road trip option. They can also be stored in the fridge for up to one week or frozen.
