time: under 55 mins
servings: 8

notes:

ingredients:
- 1.5|  tbsp  olive oil
- 1|  medium  onion,  sliced into thin strips
- 6| - 7|  large eggs
- 1.2|  cup  whole milk
- 1|  cup  grated cheddar cheese
- 1|  tsp  salt
- 0.25|  tsp  ground pepper
- 0.5| head of broccoli  chopped into bite-sized pieces
- fingerling potatoes or other baby potatoes  thinly sliced
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  
- Heat up a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat; add 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil. Wait until the oil has warmed up (you can tell by tipping the pan back and forth – once you see striations or the oil start to disperse, it’s ready) and add the onions. Add a dash of salt, and toss with tongs or a wooden spoon until the onions are coated in oil. Toss every few minutes but let them slowly brown in the pan over the next 15 minutes.
- While the onions are caramelizing, whisk eggs with milk and cheese. 
- Add 1 teaspoon of salt and 0.25 teaspoon of ground pepper. 
- After the onions have cooked for about 15 minutes, add the broccoli and potatoes; mix all ingredients together. Saute for about 3 more minutes. 
- Pour egg mixture into the pan. Shake the pan a few times so that the egg mixture settles into all the crevices between the broccoli, potatoes, and caramelized onions.
- Place skillet in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes until the top is a golden brown. Let cool for about 5 to 10 minutes. Slice and serve.
