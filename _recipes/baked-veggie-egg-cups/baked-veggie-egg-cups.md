ingredients:
- Baked Veggie Egg Cups:

- 6|  large  eggs
- 1|  cup  white eggs  or another 6 eggs
- 0.5|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.5|  teaspoon  black pepper
- 1|  teaspoon  coconut oil
- 0.5|  orange bell pepper  chopped
- 0.5|  cup  chopped yellow onion
- 1|  cup  chopped broccoli
- 1|  cup  sliced mushrooms
- 0.33333333333|  cup  crumbled feta cheese
- 2|  tablespoon  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F (191°C).
- Coat 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray, or line with silicone baking cups. (I coated the silicone baking cups with spray.)
- Whisk eggs and egg whites in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
- Heat a skillet over medium with oil. Add chopped veggies. Cook 5–6 minutes, until they’re a little soft and the onions are fragrant.
- Add veggies to eggs. Add in feta and parsley, and mix well.
- Use a measuring cup to pour egg mixture evenly into muffin cups, about 1/3 cup each. Bake for 17–20 minutes, or until the egg cups are no longer jiggly and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow cups to cool before refrigerating, or enjoy immediately.
