ingredients:
- Vegan Curry Soba Noodles With Crispy Tofu:

- 1|  package extra-firm tofu
- 2|  tablespoon  canola oil  divided
- 1|  tablespoon  soy sauce
- soba noodles
- 1.5|  cup  chopped purple cabbage
- 1|  cup  cremini mushrooms  chopped
- 3|  carrots  peeled and cut into ribbons
- 1| inch fresh ginger  grated
- 2|  cloves garlic  minced
- 1|  green onion  thinly sliced
- 1.5|  tablespoon  panang/red curry paste  I used Maesri brand
- 1|  can  light coconut milk
- 0.5|  cup  vegetable broth
- 2|  tablespoon  soy sauce
- baby spinach leaves  1/2 of a 5-ounce bag

directions:
- creamy coconut-curry sauce. Colorful veggies and crispy squares of tofu finish off this hearty, healthy dish.
- For the tofu:
    Drain tofu and slice in half vertically. Place both slabs on a plate lined with a paper towel. Top with a second towel and place something heavy on top. (I use a cast-iron skillet.) Press tofu for 15 minutes. After tofu is pressed, slice into 1 inch cubes.
    Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large skillet for 1 minute. Add the tofu and cook on one side for 2-3 minutes or until brown, shaking the pan gently periodically to keep the tofu from sticking. Gently turn over each piece and cook on the next side for 2–3 minutes. Repeat until all sides are browned. Transfer to a bowl and toss with soy sauce and Sriracha to coat. Set aside.
- For the noodles:
    Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan full of water to a boil. Add the soba noodles and cook for 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
    In a deep skillet, add 1 tablespoon of canola oil with the cabbage and mushrooms. Sauté for 6–8 minutes or until cabbage starts to soften. Stir in the carrots, ginger, garlic and green onion. Sauté for 1 minute.
    Stir in the curry paste, coconut milk, vegetable broth and soy sauce until combined. Bring to a simmer for 1–2 minutes.
    Add the cooked soba noodles to the pan and stir well to coat in sauce. Stir in the spinach leaves and cook another 1–2 minutes, stirring frequently, until spinach is wilted.
    To serve, dish noodles into bowls and top with tofu. Drizzle with Sriracha and sprinkle with chopped cilantro.
