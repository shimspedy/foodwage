ingredients:
- Cashew Beef with Broccoli Stir-Fry:

- 3|  tbsp  reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 1|  tbsp  rice wine vinegar
- 0.25|  tsp  red pepper flakes
- trimmed boneless beef top round  cut across the grain into thin slices, slices cut into 1″ bite-size pieces
- 2|  whole stalks broccoli  cut into small florets, stems halved lengthwise and very thinly sliced crosswise (about 5 cups)
- 0.33|  cup  reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 1|  tbsp  cornstarch
- 2|  tbsp  canola oil
- 3|  cloves garlic,  thinly sliced
- 1|  piece  fresh ginger  peeled and sliced into thin strips
- 1|  large  red bell pepper,  cut into thin strips
- 2|  tbsp  cashews
- 2|  cup  cooked brown rice optional
directions:
- In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, and red-pepper flakes. Add the beef and toss to mix. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
- Meanwhile, place a steamer basket in a large pot with 2″ of water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Place the broccoli in the basket, cover, and steam for 6 to 8 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Remove the broccoli from the steamer and rinse briefly under cold running water. Set aside.
- Drain the beef, reserving the marinade.
- Mix the broth and cornstarch in a cup. In a large, deep nonstick skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the garlic and ginger and stirfry for 30 seconds, just until fragrant; do not brown. Add half the drained beef strips and stir-fry about 2 minutes, or just until no longer pink; transfer to a clean plate. Repeat with the remaining beef strips.
- Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Add the bell pepper and stir-fry until just crisptender, about 2 minutes. Return the beef and any juices, the reserved marinade, and the steamed broccoli to the skillet. Toss to mix. Stir-fry about 2 minutes, or until heated through. Stir the cornstarch mixture again; add to the skillet and cook, stirring, until the mixture boils and thickens. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with the cashews. Serve over the rice.
