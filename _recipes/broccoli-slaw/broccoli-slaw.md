meal: brunch 
chef: diana 
time: under 20mins
servings: 4

notes: 
- Buy broccoli with the stems. Some stores only sell broccoli crowns, but if you are lucky, you can find broccoli with the long stems still attached. I actually prefer broccoli stems to the florets!
- Cut the crown away from the stems and slice or tear into very small florets.
- Peel the tough outer layer of the broccoli stems. I use a vegetable peeler.
- Slice the stems into thin matchsticks or grate them using a hand grater or the grating attachment of a food processor. *In the photos, I did this by hand.* 

ingredients:
- 1| pound broccoli with stems *(2 to 3 small heads)*
- 1| bunch scallions, thinly sliced
- 0.5| cup loosely packed fresh parsley leaves, coarsely chopped
- 150|g golden raisins, substitute any dried fruit
- 150|g shelled sunflower seeds, substitute any nut or seed
- 170|g mayonnaise
- 2| tsp apple cider vinegar or more to taste
- 2| tbsps Dijon or coarse ground mustard
- 0.25| tsp fine sea salt or more to taste
- 0.25| tsp fresh ground black pepper or more to taste
- 3| dashes toasted sesame oil,*optional, see notes*

directions:
- Remove the broccoli florets from the larger stems and cut into smaller pieces.
- Remove the woodiest part of the stem — usually 1/2-inch from the bottom — and discard (or save for stock). Using a vegetable peeler, peel away the thick tough outer layer of the stems, and then grate or slice into small matchsticks. Place the broccoli in a very large bowl (you will have 6 to 8 cups).
- Add the sliced scallions, parsley, raisins and sunflower seeds to the broccoli and toss to mix.
- In a separate bowl, stir the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper together. Taste for acidity and seasoning then adjust as desired. For a little extra flavor, add two to three small dashes of toasted sesame oil (see notes). Pour two-thirds of the dressing over the slaw, and then mix well.
- If the broccoli slaw seems dry, add a little more of the dressing. Eat right away or let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour to let the flavors mingle.

Just like other coleslaws, this broccoli slaw is perfect for making ahead of time.
Make it, and then store in an airtight container in the fridge up to 3 days. 🔪
