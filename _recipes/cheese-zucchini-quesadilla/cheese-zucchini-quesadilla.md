ingredients:
Quesadilla:

- 0.5|  small zucchini  thinly sliced
- 0.25|  medium sweet white onion  diced
- 2|  small whole-wheat tortillas  about 120 calories each
- 1|  ounce  cabra al vino goat cheese  or cheese of choice

Optional Toppings:

- 1|  tablespoon  guacamole
- 1|  tablespoon  salsa
- 2| slices  tomato
- 1|  tablespoon  cilantro
directions:
- In a pan on medium heat, cook the zucchini and onion together with a bit of salt and pepper until they begin to soften and brown (about 5 minutes). Remove from the heat.
- Oil the pan (or use spray), and place one tortilla down. Crumble half the cheese on top of it, layer the veggies on top of the cheese, and then crumble the additional cheese on top. Push the other tortilla down on top.
- Cook the tortilla on one side for about 3 minutes, and then flip and cook it on its other side for about 2 minutes. It should be browning nicely and crisping up.
- Slice the quesadilla into quarters, and serve with guacamole, salsa, tomato and cilantro.

Quesadillas are one of the most flexible entrees to make, and Uproot Kitchen demonstrates this concept with her winning cheese and zucchini quesadillas. Tender sauteed onions and zucchini are aptly paired with savory goat cheese and crispy whole-wheat tortillas.
