ingredients:
- For the pork shoulder:

- 1.5|  tablespoons  cumin
- 1.5|  tablespoons dried oregano
- 1.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 1|  pork shoulder  (3.5 pounds or 1,590 grams) trimmed of as much fat as possible
- 1|  tablespoon  cooking oil
- 4|  cloves garlic, smashed
- 1|  medium  white onion, thinly sliced
- 1|  lime, juiced
- 1|  cup  oranges, juiced  2 medium oranges 140 grams each
- 0.5|  cup  water

- For the sliders:

- 8|  whole-grain slider rolls  about 70 calories per roll
- 8|  teaspoon  Dijon mustard
- 16|  pickle slices

directions:
- Prepare the rub by putting cumin, oregano and salt into a small bowl. Toss with a fork to combine.
- Sprinkle rub over the pork shoulder, and use your fingers to massage the rub into the pork shoulder.
- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Put cooking oil into the skillet, and allow it to heat. Add the pork shoulder to the skillet and sear until it is brown all over, about 7–10 minutes.
- Put the pork shoulder into the slow cooker first. Then add the garlic, onion, lime juice, orange juice and water. Cook pork shoulder on low for 6–8 hours, until meat completely falls apart.
- Take the pork shoulder out of the slow cooker, and shred the meat with a pair of tongs or two forks. Add as much juice from the slow cooker as needed to your shredded pork to keep it moist and juicy.
- Split the slider buns and toast them. Spread each bun with 1 tablespoon mustard, and top with a slice of Swiss cheese and 2 pickle slices. Sprinkle salt to taste, and serve.
