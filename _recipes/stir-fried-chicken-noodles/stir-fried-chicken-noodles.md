servings: 4

notes:


ingredients:
- Stir-Fried Chicken Noodles

- boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- lo mein noodles  or other thick long noodle
- 2|  tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce
- tablespoon  brown sugar
- 3.5|  tablespoon  cornstarch
- 0.5|  cup  chicken stock
- 3|  garlic cloves  minced
- 4|  Roma tomatoes  chopped
- 3|  tablespoon  cooking oil  divided
- baby spinach
- 0.5|  lemon  juiced
- Hot sauce  to taste
- Salt and pepper

directions:
- Tenderize the chicken breasts by piercing them all over with a fork. Slice thinly, season with salt and pepper, then set aside.
- Cook noodles as directed on package.
- Meanwhile, mix together the soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch and chicken stock in a medium bowl. Set aside.
- Place a wok over medium-high heat. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of cooking oil to the wok.
- Toss the chicken with the remaining 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, then add to the wok.
- Sauté, tossing or stirring often, until the exterior is golden, about 4–6 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate, and set aside. (Don’t worry, the chicken doesn’t have to be cooked all the way through at this point.)
- Return the wok to heat, and add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. Add the garlic to the heated oil, and as soon as you can smell the garlic, throw in the tomatoes. Sauté until the tomatoes have broken down and started to release liquids, about 5 minutes.
- Return the chicken to the wok, and push everything to the sides, forming a well in the middle. Pour the sauce into the well.
- When the sauce starts to bubble and thicken, toss in the spinach and cooked noodles, and mix everything together. Continue cooking until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink.
- Finish with lemon juice, and season with as much hot sauce as you want and salt and pepper as needed.
