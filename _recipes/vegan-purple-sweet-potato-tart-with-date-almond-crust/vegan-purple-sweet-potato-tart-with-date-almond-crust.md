ingredients:
- For the crust:

- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 1|  cup  almonds
- 1|  cup  unsweetened shredded coconut
- 1.33333333333|  cup  medjool dates  pitted
- 3|  tsp  coconut oil

- For the filling:

- 3|  cup  purple sweet potatoes,  roasted with skin removed
- 0.5|  cup  maple syrup
- 0.66666666666|  cup  coconut oil  melted
- 4|  tbsp  almond or coconut milk
- 1|  tbs  apple cider vinegar
- 1|  tsp  cinnamon
- 0.25|  tsp  ground ginge
- 0.25|  tsp  ground nutmeg
- 1| or 4|  tbsp  cold water

directions:
- In the bowl of a food processor, fitted with the blade attachment, pulse together the almonds, coconut and salt until a coarse meal forms. (You don’t want any big chunks of almond to remain, but you don’t want almond butter.) Pour the mixture out into a large bowl and set aside.
- Next, process the dates and coconut oil until the mixture is smooth like a paste. Transfer the date paste to the bowl with the almond mixture and work it into a cohesive dough with your hands. Press the well-combined mixture into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, then place the crust in the refrigerator to chill while you make the filling.
- Wash the food processor bowl and blade. Chop the roasted, de-skinned purple sweet potatoes into chunks. In the food processor bowl, combine the potato with the maple syrup, coconut oil, milk, vinegar and spices. Process until smooth. Add water by the tablespoon, if necessary, until the potato mixture is smooth and creamy.
- Transfer the sweet potato filling to the prepared crust. Smooth the filling evenly over the crust, pressing with the back of a spatula to decoratively finish the surface of the tart. Chill for at least 2 hours to set. Then slice and serve
