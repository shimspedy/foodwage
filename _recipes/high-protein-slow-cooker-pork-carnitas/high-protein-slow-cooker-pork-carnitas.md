ingredients:
- High-Protein Slow Cooker Pork Carnitas:

- sirloin tip pork roast
- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 0.5|  tablespoon  chili powder
- 0.5|  tablespoon  cumin
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 1|  teaspoon  dried oregano
- 1|  medium  white onion
- 3|  cloves garlic minced
- 1|  jalapeno de-seeded  finely chopped
- 1|  large  orange juiced

directions:
- Dry the sirloin tip roast with a paper towel. Season with olive oil, chili powder, dried oregano, cumin, and salt.
- Chop the large onion into quarters. Dice three-quarters of the onion; this will go into the slow cooker. Finely dice the remaining one-quarter onion and set aside for garnish.
- Place the sirloin tip roast into the slow cooker. Top with diced onions, minced garlic, and chopped jalapeno pepper. Pour in the orange juice. Set slow cooker to “high” and wait for five hours.
- Pull the cooked pork out of the slow cooker onto a large plate or baking sheet. Use a fork to shred the meat. Reserve one cup of broth from the slow cooker and set aside.
- Spray a large cast-iron or non-stick skillet with oil. Heat over medium-high and add half the pork. Cook the meat for about five minutes on each side until desired color and crispiness is achieved.
- Assemble your tacos with corn tortillas, chopped onion, cilantro, and lime. Use a small spoon to ladle some broth over each taco to moisten the meat (totally optional!).
