Set aside some bacon and green onion for garnish and then repeat with a second layer of hash brown, bacon, cheese and onion.
- In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, salt, and pepper and slowly pour over top. Cook until eggs are set, approximately 2 or 3 hours on high, or 4 or 5 hours on low. Sprinkle remaining bacon and onions on top and serve immediately, with or without hot sauce.
