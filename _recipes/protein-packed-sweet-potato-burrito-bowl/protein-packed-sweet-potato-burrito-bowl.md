notes:


ingredients:
- Protein-Packed Sweet Potato Burrito Bowl:

- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil  divided
- 1|  large sweet potato  spiralized or shredded
- Salt and pepper  to taste
- 2|  eggs
- 8|  white eggs  about 1 cup
- 0.5|  cup  salsa  plus more for topping, if desired
- 1|  avocado  diced
-  Fresh cilantro optional

directions:
- Heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the potato noodles, and cook until they just begin to soften, about 5–7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
- While the potatoes cook, fill a large pot with a few inches of water and place over medium-high heat until it starts to simmer.
- Once simmering, crack the eggs into the pot, keeping them as close to surface of the water as you can, leaving space between the eggs. Cover the pot, turn off the heat and let sit for 4–5 minutes, until the eggs are cooked but still soft in the center.
- While the eggs poach, heat the remaining teaspoon of oil in a medium pan over medium high heat. Scramble the egg whites until they are lightly golden brown.
- Transfer the cooked potato noodles into a large bowl and toss with 1/2 cup of the salsa until well-mixed. Add the scrambled egg whites, and mix well.
- Divide the noodles between two bowls. Top with diced avocado, cilantro and additional salsa, if desired.
