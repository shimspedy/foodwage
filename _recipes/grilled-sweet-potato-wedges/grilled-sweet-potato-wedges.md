meal: lunch dinner
chef: foodwage
time: under 45 mins
servings: 6

notes:

ingredients:
- Wedges:

- 4| medium sweet potatoes  scrubbed but not peeled
- 1| teaspoon kosher salt
- 1| tablespoon lime zest  (the zest of one whole lime)
- 0.125| teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 3| tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1|  whole lime  juiced
- 0.33|  cup  fresh cilantro

directions:
- Boil the potatoes until they are fork-tender, approximately 25 minutes. Remove the potatoes from water and allow them to cool slightly.
- Meanwhile, combine the kosher salt, lime zest, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Mix well. Set aside. Once the potatoes are cool enough to cut, slice into 6 wedges per potato. (Anything smaller will burn too fast on the grill!)
- Brush the potato wedges with vegetable oil and place on the grill. Grill until golden in color, about 4-5 minutes. Flip the wedges, and grill for another 4-5 minutes.
- Remove wedges from the grill, sprinkle lightly with lime juice, kosher salt mixture, and chopped cilantro.
