These parmesan chicken tenders from Cooking Light are an awesome addition to lunch boxes, especially for kids! Lean chicken breast is dredged in a buttermilk-egg mixture before being coated in Parmesan cheese and spices. This gives the chicken a finger-lickin’ good coating while keeping it moist in the oven. Serve with a side of roasted or steamed veggies and gobble them up for dinner.
