notes:


ingredients:
- Miso and Black Garlic Mashed Potatoes:

- red potatoes  scrubbed
- 2|  tbsp  butter
- 2|  tbsp  white miso paste
- 2|  tbsp  soy milk or whole-fat dairy milk
- 2|  tsp  black garlic powder  or 2 cloves black garlic, finely chopped
- 3|  tsp  minced fresh chives, parsley, cilantro or green onion
- Salt and pepper

directions:
- In a large pot, add the potatoes and cover with water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then turn heat to medium and let cook for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork.
- Drain the water, leaving the potatoes in the pot. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher or pastry blender. Set aside.
- Warm the milk, butter and miso paste over medium heat, whisking to incorporate. Once the mixture is smooth, add it to the potatoes and mix well with the pastry blender or potato masher. Add the black garlic powder and taste the potatoes, adding salt and pepper to your preferences. (If the potatoes are too thick for your liking, you can add additional milk by the tablespoon until they reach your desired consistency.)
- Mix in half of the herbs, then sprinkle the other half over the potatoes just before serving.

Creamy, dreamy, savory and satisfying, mashed potatoes are what holiday dinner dreams are made of. By using miso paste and less butter, you can still have the best of mashed potatoes, but with less fat and more flavor.
Miso is a fermented soybean product that lends an umami kick to anything it gets whipped into. Pair that with the bold flavor of black (or fermented) garlic, a spot of butter and milk, and youâ€™re really onto something.
Black garlic and miso paste are both readily available in your local Asian foods markets, or a well-stocked natural grocery store. Black garlic may be found by the clove or in a powder; the powder form is easiest to add here. Miso paste comes in several different colors (red, yellow and white) each with its own unique flavor profile. White miso is recommended here
