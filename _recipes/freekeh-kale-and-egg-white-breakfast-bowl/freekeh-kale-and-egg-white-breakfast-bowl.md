ingredients:
- Freekeh, Kale and Egg White Breakfast Bowl:

- 1|  cup  freekeh
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt  divided
- 4|  teaspoon  olive oil  divided
- 4|  cup  chopped kale
- 2|  large carrots  quartered and sliced
- 8|  large egg whites  lightly beaten
- 0.5|  teaspoon  dried thyme
- 24|  grape tomatoes  halved
- 2| small avocados
- 4|  teaspoon  Sriracha sauce

directions:
- In a medium pot, cook the freekeh over medium-high heat. Swirl the grain for a minute to heat, then add 2 cups water, 0.25 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low for 20 minutes. When the water is absorbed, let stand, covered, for about 5 minutes or until time to serve. Freekeh can be cooked up to 4 days in advance, refrigerated and reheated in the microwave or on the stovetop.
- In a large saute pan, warm 2 teaspoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the kale and carrots and stir, cooking until the kale is wilted and the carrots are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. While the kale is cooking, place a smaller saute pan over medium heat and add the remaining teaspoon of olive oil. Whisk the thyme into the egg whites and pour them into the pan. Scramble the egg whites until firm and cooked, about 2 minutes.
- Cut the avocados in half with a chefs knife and use the knife to twist out the pit. Use a paring knife to thinly slice the avocado flesh lengthwise in the shell, then use a soup spoon to scoop the slices out neatly.
- Divide the freekeh between four wide cereal bowls and top with the kale mixture, egg whites and grape tomatoes. Fan half an avocado over each bowl and drizzle with Sriracha, to taste.

Freekeh is a form of green wheat that has been pre-roasted and par-cooked, so it has a smoky, nutty flavor. Bonus: It cooks quickly and delivers protein, vitamins and minerals.
