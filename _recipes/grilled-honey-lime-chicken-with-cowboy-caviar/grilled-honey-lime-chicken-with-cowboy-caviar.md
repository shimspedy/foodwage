Part bean salad and part salsa dip, cowboy caviar is a vibrant combination of black-eyed peas, corn, tomatoes, onions and avocado. We pour it over grilled chicken, marinated with honey and lime, for a recipe that’s anything but boring. Serve over greens for a low-carb meal or over brown rice for energizing carbs and fiber.
