Look no further for a simple dinner recipe than these tender chicken drumsticks simmered in a sweet and tangy sauce. The acid in the vinegar-based marinade helps the meat retain its moisture and stay juicy. While the recipe uses balsamic vinegar, some other acids to try include citrus juice (think: lemon, lime, orange) and white vinegar.
