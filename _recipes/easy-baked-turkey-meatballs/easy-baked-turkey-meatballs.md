ingredients:
- Meatballs:

- 2|  pounds  100% ground turkey breast
- 0.5|  cup  unseasoned breadcrumbs
- 0.5|  cup  carrot
- 0.25| cup  onion

- 1|  tablespoon  Italian seasoning
- 1|  teaspoon  salt
- 1|  teaspoon  garlic powder
- 1|  dash  red pepper flakes  optional

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F. Finely mince carrot and onion by hand or in a food processor and then combine all ingredients. Use your hands to gently mix.
- Shape meatballs into 2-tablespoon-sized-balls and place on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper.
- Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, checking at 30 minutes to ensure there is no pink in the middle of the meatballs. Cook for 5 more minutes if needed.
- Serve with pasta or spaghetti squash, and your favorite tomato sauce. You can veg it up by adding sautéed onion, zucchini, red pepper, and grape tomatoes.
- You can freeze the meatballs in a plastic bag in the freezer for up to 3 months, letting them defrost in the fridge or microwave before eating.

Frozen meatballs are a great way to prep an easy dinner when you don’t have anything else planned. These Easy Baked Turkey Meatballs from Uproot Kitchen are healthier than the traditional version. Turkey is one of the most protein-rich meats and it’s also low in saturated fat — a great combination if you ask us.
