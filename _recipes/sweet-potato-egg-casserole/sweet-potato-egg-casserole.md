ingredients:
- Sweet Potato Egg Casserole:

- 1|  medium  sweet potato  scrubbed clean
- 1.5|  tablespoon  olive oil  divided
- 0.5|  tablespoon  dried rosemary
- 0.25|  tablespoon  sea salt
- 1.5|  teaspoon  butter
- 4|  garlic cloves  minced
- 2|  cup  spinach  thinly sliced
- 8|  large  eggs
- 0.5|  cup  milk
- 1|  cup  shredded cheese
- 0.25|  cup  sliced green onions  optional

directions:
- Heat oven to 375°F, and line a baking sheet with parchment.
- Thinly slice the sweet potato, place in a mixing bowl, and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle in the rosemary and sea salt, and mix well again.
- Spread the sweet potatoes on the lined baking sheet, and roast for 20 minutes. Flip them over and roast for another 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, and set aside. Turn the oven up to 400°F.
- In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt together the butter and 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Stir in the garlic, and sauté until softened, about 1–2 minutes. Continue stirring to keep from burning. Stir in the spinach. Cook over medium-low for another 2-3 minutes, until wilted. Remove from heat, and set aside.
- Grease a 9-by-9-inch baking dish, and layer the potatoes evenly on the bottom. Cover them with the spinach, and set aside.
- In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk, then pour over the potatoes and spinach. Sprinkle on the shredded cheese
- Bake for 25 minutes, until the center is set. Turn the broiler to high, and broil for 2 minutes to crisp up the top.
    
- Let sit for 5 minutes before slicing. Garnish with sliced green onions.
