ingredients:
- Enchiladas:

- 1|  tablespoon  vegetable oil
- 2|  teaspoons  vegetable oil
- 4|  scallions  thinly sliced
- 3|  cloves garlic  minced
- 1|  large pickled jalapeno pepper  minced
- 0.66|  cup  chopped cilantro
- 1|  tablespoon  lemon juice
- 0.66|  cup  reduced-fat (2%) milk
- 1|  tablespoon  flour
- 0.75|  pound  boneless center-cut pork loin chops  cut into 2 x 0.25 inch strips
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 1|  large tomato  coarsely chopped
- 0.5|  cup  frozen corn kernels  thawed (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 8|  spinach whole wheat tortillas  about 6 inches in diameter; certified gluten-free if necessary
- 0.33|  cup  crumbled feta cheese
directions:
- In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat. Add the scallions, garlic, and jalapeno, and cook until the scallions and garlic are tender, about 2 minutes.
- Transfer the mixture to a food processor. Add 1/3 cup of the cilantro and the lemon juice, and process until smooth. Add the milk and flour, and process until well combined. Set aside.
- Preheat the oven to 350°F. In the same skillet, heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat. Add the pork, sprinkle with the salt, and cook until just cooked through, about 3 minutes.
- Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tomato, corn, and remaining 1/3 cup cilantro. Spoon the pork mixture down the center of each tortilla and roll up. Spoon 1/4 cup of the sauce into a 7 x 11-inch baking dish. Place the enchiladas, seam-side down, in the dish, and spoon the remaining sauce on top.
- Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle the feta on top, and return to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is just melted.
