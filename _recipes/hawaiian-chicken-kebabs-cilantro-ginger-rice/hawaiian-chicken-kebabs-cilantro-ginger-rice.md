The flavors of the Pacific (sweet pineapple, ginger and soy) accompany bite-sized pieces of boneless chicken in this grilled kebab. The secret ingredient? Toasted sesame oil. Its strong aroma means it only takes a small amount to add big flavor. Serve kebab over cilantro lime rice for a complete meal.
