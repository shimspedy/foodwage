ingredients:
- Ham & Asparagus Mini Quiches:

- 1|  cup  all-purpose flour
- 2|  tablespoon  butter  diced
- 6|  tablespoon  ice water

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F.

- In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the flour and butter until the butter breaks down into small pieces. (Alternately, use a pastry cutter or two forks.)
- When the butter is completely combined, add one tablespoon water at a time while the mixer runs (or while stirring with a fork) until a smooth dough forms.
- Lightly press the dough into each cup of the muffin pan and up the sides.
- In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and ricotta until smooth. Set aside.
- Add the chopped ham, asparagus and cheese to the muffin tins, and pour egg mixture over until 3/4 full.
- Bake for 20 minutes. Serve immediately.
- To reheat, bake at 300°F for 15 minutes.
