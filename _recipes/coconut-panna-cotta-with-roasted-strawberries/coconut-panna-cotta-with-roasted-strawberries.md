meal: breakfast
chef: foodwage
time: under 4 hour 30 mins
servings: 4

notes:
- This dessert requires some advanced planning, but it’s surprisingly hands-off  Whip up the custard base before your guests arrive, then pop it in the fridge for the gelatin to set. When it’s time to serve dessert, the panna cotta will be thick and creamy and ready to eat.


ingredients:
- Panna Cotta:

- 1.5| tsp powdered gelatin
- 13.5| oz full-fat coconut milk 1 can
- 1| tsp vanilla extract
- 0.125| tsp fine sea salt
- 3| tbsp agave syrup or light honey
- 1| lbs strawberries hulled and halved, quartered if large
- to taste Tarragon optional garnishes
- to taste torn mint leaves optional garnishes

directions:
- In a medium saucepan, whisk the coconut milk with the vanilla, sea salt and 2 tablespoons of the agave syrup. Bring to a gentle simmer over moderately-low heat. Be careful not to let the coconut milk boil. In a small bowl, whisk the gelatin with 1 tablespoon of water. Add the gelatin to the coconut milk and whisk to dissolve; remove from heat.
- Strain the coconut milk through a fine mesh sieve set over a large measuring cup. Divide the coconut milk between 4 glasses or ramekins, leaving space at the top. Set on a plate or rimmed quarter sheet pan and transfer to the refrigerator. Refrigerate until set, about 4 hours.
- Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300°F (149ºC). Spread the strawberries on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of agave syrup; toss to coat. Bake the strawberries, stirring occasionally, until the juices have reduced to a syrup and the berries are very tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a 1-pint jar and let cool completely.
- To serve, remove the panna cottas from the fridge. Spoon some of the roasted strawberries and their juices on top of each panna cotta. Garnish with fresh tarragon and mint leaves and serve right away.
- Make ahead: The panna cottas and the roasted strawberries can be refrigerated separately overnight. Bring the strawberries to room temperature before serving.

Panna cotta is a cold and refreshing Italian custard. This completely dairy-free version is made with full-fat coconut milk and topped with intensely juicy roasted strawberries. While you may be tempted to reach for a can of low-fat coconut milk, coconut cream is what gives this panna cotta all of its flavor.
