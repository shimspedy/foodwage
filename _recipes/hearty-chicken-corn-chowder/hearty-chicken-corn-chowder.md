ingredients:
- Hearty Chicken & Corn Chowder:

- 1|  tablespoon  butter
- 1|  medium  onion, chopped
- 2|  medium  celery stalks, chopped
- 2|  garlic cloves, minced
- 1|  container reduced-sodium chicken broth  32-ounce or 910-gram
- 2|  Yukon Gold potatoes, diced  about 2 cups
- 2|  cup  fresh or frozen corn kernels
- 1|  tablespoon  fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
- 2|  cup  rotisserie-cooked chicken breast, shredded
- 4|  sprigs thyme for garnish, if desired

directions:
- In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery and garlic; sauté 2–3 minutes, or until tender.
- Add broth, potatoes, corn, thyme, salt and pepper. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, 10–15 minutes until potatoes are tender.
- Stir in chicken; cook 2 minutes until mixture is heated through. Transfer 3 cups to a large blender. Remove stopper, and cover hole with a folded towel; blend until almost smooth. Stir into remaining soup mixture. Ladle soup into serving bowls, and garnish with thyme, if desired.

For a hearty chowder that’s not thickened with flour, simply puree a portion of the soup in a blender. Blending also gives the soup a creamier texture without added milk or cream. And without the milk or cream, this soup will reheat easily without separating in a microwave if lunch portions are frozen and thawed.
