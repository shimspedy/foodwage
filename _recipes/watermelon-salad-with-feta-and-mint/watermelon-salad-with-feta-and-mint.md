ingredients:
- Watermelon Salad with Feta and Mint:

- seedless watermelon  peeled
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  small  red onion  very thinly sliced
- 3|  tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
- 1|  teaspoon  lemon zest  finely grated
- 2|  teaspoon  honey
- 2|  tablespoon  olive oil
- Black pepper  to taste
- 3|  cup  arugula or baby spinach
- 0.33333333333|  cup  crumbled feta cheese
- 4|  tablespoon  torn fresh mint leaves

directions:
- Cut the watermelon into 1-inch cubes. Sprinkle with salt and place in an even layer in a large zip-top plastic bag. Press out as much air as possible and lie the watermelon flat in the freezer. Place a few items on top to weigh the fruit down (such as bags of frozen vegetables). Freeze for 2 hours.
- Meanwhile, soak the sliced red onions in a large bowl of ice water. In a separate bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, zest and honey. Slowly whisk in the oil and season with pepper.
- Remove the watermelon from the bag and transfer to a large serving bowl. Drain the red onions, pat them dry and add them to the bowl. Add the arugula and dressing; toss to coat. Sprinkle the cheese and mint over the top of the salad and serve immediately.

Freezing watermelon briefly compresses the texture and intensifies the flavor, making for a cool, restaurant-style salad thatâ€™s actually a breeze to make. Soaking the onions in ice water makes them crunchier and more mild tasting.
