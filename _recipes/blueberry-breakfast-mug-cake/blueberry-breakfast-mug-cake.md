ingredients:
- Mug Cake:

- 0.25|  cup  Whole Wheat Pastry Flour  1|
- 1|  tbsp  Coconut Sugar  0.5|
- 0.25|  tsp  Baking Powder  1|
- 0.25|  cup  2% Milk or Unsweetened Non-Dairy Milk  2|
- 0.25|  tsp  Vanilla Extract  0.25|

directions:
- In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder and salt. In a small measuring cup, whisk together the milk, oil and vanilla. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a fork until moistened. Stir in the blueberries.
- Spoon the batter into a 12 or 16-ounce (450–473ml) mug. Sprinkle the top with nuts. Microwave on high until the cake has expanded and is firm to the touch, 1.5 or 2 minutes, depending on the wattage of your microwave. Watch closely and do not overcook. Add time in 10-second intervals if the muffin is not done. The muffin will puff up at first, but deflate as it cools.

Calling all blueberry muffin lovers! Did you know you can make a freshly baked muffin loaded with fruit in your microwave in just 2 minutes? Not only is this a time saver, but you’ll also save on sugar and calories compared to a typical bakery muffin, which has nearly 30 grams of sugar and just 1 gram of fiber.
We give a range of cooking times as wattages of microwaves vary. It’s also helpful to use a glass mug so you can see when the batter has expanded and is full of bubbles, which means it’s cooked through. Feel free to substitute the blueberries and pecans in this recipe for your favorite fresh berries and nuts.
