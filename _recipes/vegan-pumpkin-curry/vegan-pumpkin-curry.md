ingredients:
- Vegan Pumpkin Curry:

- extra-firm tofu  or 14 onces
- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  red bell pepper  chopped

- 0.125|  teaspoon  ground black pepper

directions:
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook for several minutes on each side, flipping as the bottom of the tofu begins to brown. Cook until tofu is lightly browned and crispy on most sides. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
- In the same skillet, add the onion and red bell pepper. Saute for 3–5 minutes or until onion begins to soften. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more.
- Stir in the curry paste, pumpkin, coconut milk and soy sauce and bring to a gentle simmer.
- Cut tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and stir into the skillet.
- Cook for 3 minutes. Add the spinach, salt and pepper, and cook another 3–5 minutes or until spinach is wilted.
- Serve over rice or other starch and top with a squeeze of fresh lime juice and chopped cilantro
