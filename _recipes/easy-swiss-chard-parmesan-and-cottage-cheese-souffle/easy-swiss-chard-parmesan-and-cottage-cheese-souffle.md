ingredients:
- Easy Swiss Chard, Parmesan and Cottage Cheese Soufflé:

- 1|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  large shallot  thinly sliced
- 1|  bunch Swiss chard  chopped, leaves and stems separated
- 0.5|  cup  whole-wheat pastry flour  all-purpose flour also works
- 1|  teaspoon  baking powder
- 0.25|  teaspoon  nutmeg
- 6|  large eggs  beaten
- 1|  cup  low-fat cottage cheese
- 0.75|  cup  2% milk
- 0.5|  cup  shredded Parmesan cheese
- 0.25|  teaspoon  black pepper

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray. Heat the oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the chopped chard stems and shallots and sauté until tender, 4 minutes. Add the chard leaves and cook, tossing with tongs, until wilted, 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and nutmeg. Add the eggs, cottage cheese, milk, Parmesan and nutmeg and stir until just combined. Gently fold in the chard mixture and season generously with pepper. Scrape the mixture into the prepared baking dish and bake until set in the center (a knife will come out clean when inserted into the center of the soufflé), 45–50 minutes. Serve immediately.

This easy soufflé gets its light texture from baking powder and loads of flavor from Swiss chard, Parmesan cheese and a touch of nutmeg. You can substitute bagged baby spinach or kale for the chard if you like. Added bonus: Leftovers make a great grab-and-go breakfast.
