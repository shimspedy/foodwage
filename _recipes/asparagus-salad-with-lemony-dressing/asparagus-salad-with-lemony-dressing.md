ingredients:
- Salad:
-   1|  bunch asparagus  shaved
-   8|  radishes  thinly sliced
-   1|  large bulb fennel  thinly sliced
-   0.25|  medium red onion  thinly sliced
-   0.5| cup  raw walnuts  chopped
-   0.5| cup  feta cheese crumbles
- lemon-parsley dressing:
-   1|  lemon  zest
-   3| tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
-   1|  tablespoon white vinegar
-   2| tablespoons olive oil
-   2| tablespoons fresh parsley  chopped
-   3|  cloves garlic  minced
-   0.75| teaspoon kosher salt  or to taste
- optional toppings:
-   1|  Hardboiled eggs
-   1|  Avocado slices

directions:
-  Make the lemon-parsley dressing by whisking all ingredients for dressing together; set aside until ready to serve.
    
- Rinse and prepare the asparagus, radishes, fennel and red onion. Add all vegetables except asparagus to a large salad bowl.
- For the asparagus, cut off the tough ends and discard. Then, run a vegetable peeler or potato peeler down the full length of each stalk of asparagus, adding these shavings to a large salad bowl. Once you get down to the center of the asparagus and it becomes difficult to peel, chop the remaining parts finely and add to the salad.  
- Add feta cheese and walnuts to salad bowl. Then, pour salad dressing over salad, and toss to combine. If desired, serve with hardboiled eggs and avocado slices.
