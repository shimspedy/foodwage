notes:

ingredients:
Salad:

- 1| Red Seedless Grapes, quartered Red Seedless Grapes, quartered 
- 0.25| cup Cottage Cheese 
- 1.5| tbsp Olive Oil 
- 0.25| tbsp Honey, divided

salmon:

- 1| lbs Salmon, skinless, fresh or frozen & thawed 
- 1| tbsp Chives, chopped and divided 
- 0.5| tsp Dry Mustard 

directions:
- Preheat oven to 275F. (Thatâ€™s not a typo. Baking at low temps allows the fat to slowly melt between the layers of fish producing more tender, moist meat.)
- Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Brush with 0.5 tablespoon oil. Place salmon fillets, skin side down on prepared baking sheet.
- In a small bowl, mix 0.5 tablespoon olive oil, 0.25 tablespoon honey, 1 squeeze of lemon juice, dry mustard and 1 tablespoon chives until well combined. Brush mixture over salmon fillets, dividing equally. Season with sea salt and pepper and let stand for 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld.
- Bake salmon until just opaque in center, about 15-18 minutes depending on the thickness of your filets.
- Meanwhile, mix together another squeeze of lemon juice, cottage cheese, mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, honey and remaining chives until well combined. Fold in grapes.
- When salmon has done cooking, cool for 10 minutes and then lightly break up into large chunks. Delicately fold into sauce, being careful not to over mix to preserve chunks of salmon.
