directions:
- Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
- Make the basil pesto by combining pine nuts, basil, garlic and avocado in a food processor. Pulse until ingredients are broken up. Drizzle in olive oil, while keeping the food processor on, until you get a sauce-like consistency. Season with salt and pepper. (NOTE: Basil pesto can be done 3 days ahead)
- Remove stems from portobello mushrooms and use a spoon to scrape out the inside gills (dark ridge-y stuff). Brush mushrooms with olive oil on both sides. Place mushrooms cap side down on a sheet pan. Spoon approximately 1/3 cup of basil pesto onto the mushroom. Top with sliced tomatoes and sprinkle with cheese.
- Bake in the oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until cheese is bubbly
