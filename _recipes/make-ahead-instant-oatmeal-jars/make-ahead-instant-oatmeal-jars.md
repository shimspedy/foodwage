ingredients:
- Make-Ahead Instant Oatmeal Jars:

- 0.5|  cup  uncooked quick oats
- 1|  pinch salt
- 0.125|  tsp  cinnamon spice
- 1|  tbsp  dried cranberries or dried fruit of your choice
- 1|  tbsp  almond slivers or nuts of your choice
- 1|  cup  water
directions:
- To make your oatmeal jar, layer the ingredients in the following order: oatmeal, salt, cinnamon, cranberries and almond slivers. Make as many jars as you’d like and store in a dry area. If you don’t have mason jars, feel free to make oatmeal packets using zip-lock bags. Remember to label with the date so you can keep track of freshness.
- To cook the oatmeal with boiling water, bring 1 cup water to a rolling boil. Pour water into oatmeal jar and stir. Let the oatmeal stand for 4-5 minutes to soften. Then, stir and enjoy!
- To cook the oatmeal by microwaving, pour oatmeal into a microwave-safe container large enough for it to bubble without spilling, then add 1 cup water. Microwave (at power level 7) for 2 minutes.
