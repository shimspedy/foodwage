Desserts are probably the worst diet saboteurs, but we know it’s also good — practically essential — to treat ourselves now and then. Smooth and tangy, this lightened-up and portion-controlled cheesecake satisfies without being loaded in fat, sugar and calories — or losing an ounce of decadent flavor. Cheers to eating dessert and staying on track of your health goals!
