- Cutting at an angle, core the tomatoes. Use a spoon or melon baller to remove tomato flesh from the inside, taking care to not cut into the sides of the tomatoes. If your tomatoes do not sit flat on their own, slice a very small piece off the bottom so they do not roll.
- Crack one egg into each tomato cavity. Top with basil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
- Bake for 20 minutes, until eggs are set. Let cool slightly and use a large spatula to serve.
