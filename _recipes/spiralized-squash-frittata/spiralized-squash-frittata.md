Spiralizing is an entertaining way to get fresh vegetables into your diet. This spiralized squash frittata, courtesy of Cooking Light, is mainly made from vitamin C-rich zucchini and protein-rich eggs. If you don’t have zucchini on hand, feel free to substitute carrots, parsnips or bell peppers. The best thing about eggs is that they complement many different flavor combinations, so feel free to mix and match!
