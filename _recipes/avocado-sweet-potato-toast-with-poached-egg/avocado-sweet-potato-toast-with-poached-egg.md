notes:


ingredients:
- Avocado Sweet Potato Toast with Poached Egg:

- 1|  sweet potato
- 4|  Eggland’s Best eggs
- 1|  avocado
- Sea salt
- Red pepper flakes
- Microgreens for garnish

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). Wash the sweet potato and trim off pointy ends. On a cutting board, lay sweet potato on its side and slice lengthwise into 0.25 inch slices (you’ll be looking for at least four slices). Place the sweet potato slices on prepared baking tray. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the sweet potatoes are soft.
- While the sweet potato is baking, scoop out the flesh of the avocado into a bowl. Season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Mash with a fork until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
- Poach your eggs: Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, and then reduce it to a simmer. Crack one egg at a time into a small serving dish or measuring cup so you don’t have to crack it directly into the simmering water. Slowly stir the water in a circular motion as you gently slide the egg into the water, cooking for 3–4 minutes. Remove the egg with a strainer ladle and place on a plate covered with a paper towel.
- When sweet potato toasts are ready, remove from the oven and place each slice on a serving plate. Spread the mashed avocado over the sweet potato toast and top with poached eggs. Season with sea salt and red pepper flakes, and garnish top with micro greens.
