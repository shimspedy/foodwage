- 1|  teaspoon  ground ginger
- 0.25|  teaspoon  crushed red pepper

directions:
- In a large zip-top bag, combine soy sauce, garlic, honey, ginger and pepper flakes. Add steak, seal bag and turn to coat. Marinate in refrigerator for 1–4 hours.
- Cook rice according to package directions.
- Meanwhile, fill a separate saucepan halfway with water and bring to a simmer. Add spinach and cook until wilted, 1 minute. Drain spinach in a colander, pressing to remove as much moisture as possible. In a medium bowl, toss spinach with oil and salt; set aside. In a small bowl, toss carrots with vinegar; set aside.
- Heat a grill pan to medium-high. Remove steak from bag, discarding marinade. Grill steak to desired doneness, 4–5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Using a serrated knife, thinly slice against the grain.
- Mist a medium nonstick skillet with cooking spray, and set heat to medium. Cook eggs over easy, until whites are set but yolks are still runny.
- Divide rice among bowls. Place steak, spinach, carrots, and kimchi in small mounds over rice. Place 1 cooked egg in each bowl, and sprinkle with onions.
