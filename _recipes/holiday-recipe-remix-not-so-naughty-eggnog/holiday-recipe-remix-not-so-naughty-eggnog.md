Many of us find eggnog’s sweet, creamy and boozy qualities too good to resist this time of year. Regardless of whether or not yours is spiked with bourbon and brandy though, the nearly 200 calories and 9 grams fat in one small glass of traditional eggnog isn’t ideal.
We received numerous eggnog recipe submissions from users wanting a little help lightening up their recipe. But in the end, it was Nancy’s Best Eggnog that was just too naughty (but nice) to ignore. We’re talking heavy whipping cream, half & half, whole milk and alcohol.
The main ingredient in the remixed nog became 1% low-fat milk. Not only did using milk in place of cream cut major fat and calories, but it more than doubled the amount of protein in a serving.
The remixed recipe tasted identical to the real stuff but, per serving, had:
70 fewer calories  5 less grams of fat  More than double the protein — at more than 5 grams in a 1/2 cup
