ingredients:

- 1|  large egg yolk
- 2|  tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 3|  tablespoons  canola oil
- 2|  tablespoon  water
- 1.5|  cup  pecan halves, divided
- 1|  tablespoon  granulated sugar
- 1|  cup  flour  add 2 tablespoons
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt, divided
- 1.5|  cup  sweet potato  roasted or microwaved and skins removed
- 0.25|  cup  brown sugar, divided  Add 2 tablespoons
- 0.25|  cup  maple syrup, divided  add 1 tablespoon
- 1|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- 0.5|  teaspoon  cinnamon
- 0.25|  teaspoon  ginger
- 4|  teaspoon  nutmeg
- 3|  egg  lightly beaten, divided
- 2|  tablespoons  bourbon  add 1 teaspoon

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400F and very lightly grease a 9-inch tart pan.
- Combine egg yolk, melted butter, oil and water in a small bowl. Process 1/2 cup pecans and 1 tablespoon sugar in a food processor to the consistency of coarse meal.
- Transfer to a small mixing bowl and add flour and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Mix to combine. Slowly drizzle the yolk mixture into the pecan mixture while stirring. Mix with hands until crumbly and just combined. Spread evenly into the prepared pan, pressing it firmly into the bottom and all the way up the sides to form a crust. Place on a baking sheet and bake until dry and just beginning to brown on the edges, about 12 minutes. When done, remove crust from oven. Fill any cracks with a sprinkle of flour and a dry pastry brush, sealing the flour into the cracks.
- Reduce oven temperature to 350F.
- Combine the sweet potato, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup maple syrup, 1 teaspoon vanilla, ½ teaspoon cinnamon, ½ teaspoon ginger, ¼ teaspoon nutmeg, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons bourbon in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Add 2 beaten eggs and pulse blender until just incorporated. Evenly spread the filling in the crust.
- In a separate bowl, mix remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, 1 lightly beaten egg and 1 teaspoon bourbon. Toss remaining 1 cup of pecans in mixture until well coated. Arrange the pecans decoratively on top and drizzle any remaining maple mixture on top of the tart.
- Bake for 30 minutes, until the tart is set and the crust has browned. Let cool on a wire rack for about 20 minutes. Remove the sides of the pan and let cool completely, about 45 minutes to 1 hour before serving. Can be made one day ahead of time and chilled in the refrigerator overnight.

Welcome to another webisode of Holiday Recipe Remix! In case you’re tuning in for the first time, here’s the story so far: a few weeks ago we asked you to submit your favorite unhealthy holiday recipes 

Bourbon-laced pecan pie topped with whipped cream is undoubtedly a holiday staple;  It’s probably not much of a surprise that pecan pie is usually loaded with corn syrup, which translates to lots of added sugar and empty calories. RaeLynn’s recipe called for 1.5 cups of corn syrup alone. Forget we said good – that just sounds scary.

Elle got her hands on the recipe and swapped out the corn syrup for vitamin-packed sweet potato, brown sugar and a little maple syrup. She also ditched the frozen pie crust and made her own pecan tart crust. One thing Elle did keep? The bourbon, of course!

The end result? A lighter, more flavorful pecan dessert that, per slice, has:

200 fewer calories  10% less saturated fat  Over 30 fewer grams of sugar  Approximately 150% of your daily Vitamin A  About 10% of your daily iron
