ingredients:
- Cauliflower “Rice” Bowl With Roasted Carrot:

- 1|  small  carrot
- 1|  teaspoon  dark sesame oil  divided
- 2|  spritzes vegetable oil spray
- 2|  cups  cauliflower, large florets  or 1.5| cups pre-made cauliflower rice
- 0.5|  teaspoon  rice vinegar  unseasoned
- 1|  large  egg
- 1|  large  egg white
- 1|  teaspoon  tamari soy sauce  divided
- 0.5|  sugar
- 1|  large  scallion  chopped, divided
- 1|  cup  fresh spinach  slivered
- 2|  tablespoon  0% Greek yogurt
- 1|  tsp  wasabi powder
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF (205ºC). Peel and halve a carrot lengthwise, then cut the pieces in half to make four planks. Place in a bread pan or other small pan and drizzle with half of the sesame oil, toss to coat. Cover the pan with foil and roast for 20 minutes, depending on the size of the carrots, until tender when pierced with a paring knife. Let cool.
- Place the cauliflower florets in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until minced to the size of rice.
- Spritz a small, nonstick saute pan with oil and add the cauliflower “rice.” Place over medium-high heat and stir until the cauliflower is softened, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a wide cereal bowl and let cool.
- In a medium bowl, whisk the egg and egg white just to mix, then whisk in half of the tamari, the sugar and half of the scallion.
- In an 8-inch nonstick saute pan, spread the remaining sesame oil and place over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture, and let cook undisturbed for about 2 minutes. When the omelette is firm around the edges and almost cooked through, use a spatula to flip it in the pan. Cook for a few seconds longer to set the last bit of eggs. Slide onto a cutting board and let cool. Roll up like a cinnamon roll and slice in 0.5|-inch wide strips, reserve.
- In a small bowl, stir the yogurt and wasabi powder.
- To serve, arrange the carrot, omelette and spinach on the cauliflower rice, sprinkle with remaining tamari and scallions, then dollop the wasabi mixture in the middle.

If you love sushi, but want to cut the carbs, try this easy cauliflower-based bowl. Pulse cauliflower florets in the food processor, and you have a veggie stand-in for sushi rice. Roasting carrots with a touch of sesame oil makes it nutty and sweet. Eggs take on a whole new attitude when seasoned with a bit of tamari and sugar, transforming into a Japanese omelette to serve sliced and strewn across the bowl.
