meal: breakfast
chef: foodwage
time: under 15 mins
servings: 4

notes:
- The secret ingredient? Toasted sesame oil. Its strong aroma means it only takes a small amount to add big flavor. Serve kebab over cilantro lime rice for a complete meal.

ingredients:
- French Toast:

- 4|  slices  whole grain bread
- 0.25| medium banana  thinly sliced
- 2| tablespoons  almond butter  or nut butter of choice
- 0.25| cup  unsweetened vanilla almond milk
- 2|  large eggs
- 0.5| teaspoon  vanilla
- 0.5| teaspoon  cinnamon
- 0.125| teaspoon  sea salt
- 1|  teaspoon  coconut oil  or choice of choice
- to taste  Maple syrup  optional toppings
- to taste  fresh berries  optional toppings
directions:
- Take your four slices of bread and create two almond butter and banana sandwiches. Each sandwich should have 1 tablespoon of almond butter and a few banana slices.
- Whisk together almond milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon and salt and pour in a container large enough to soak the sandwiches. One at a time, soak sandwiches on both sides until they are nice and moist â€” about 10 seconds on each side.
- Pre-heat a non stick skillet on medium-high heat. Coat with coconut oil to prevent toast from sticking.
- Place sandwich in pan and cook for 4-5 minutes on until the bottom side is golden brown. Flip sandwich, press on sandwich with your spatula and cook for another 4-5 minutes. Remove from pan and repeat the process with the second sandwich.
- Cut each sandwich in half diagonally to make 4 servings. Serve with fresh berries and a drizzle of maple syrup.
