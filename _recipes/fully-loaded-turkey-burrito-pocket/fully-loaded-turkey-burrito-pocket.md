ingredients:
- Fully Loaded Turkey Burrito Pocket:

- turkey breast meat  sliced into strips
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt-free Mexican seasoning
- 1|  reduced-fat, whole-wheat tortilla  8-inch
- 1|  tablespoon  light sour cream
- 0.25|  cup  finely shredded light cheddar cheese  plus 2 tablespoons
- 1|  cup  shredded lettuce
- 3|  tablespoon  salsa  excess liquid drained

directions:
- In a small bowl, toss the turkey with the seasoning until well combined.
- Place a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When it’s hot, mist the pan with cooking spray, and add the turkey. Cook the turkey, stirring occasionally until lightly browned and no longer pink inside, about 2–4 minutes. Remove the strips to a bowl, and cover to keep warm.
- Reduce the heat to medium. Place the tortilla in the pan. Cook for 30–60 seconds per side, or until warmed.
- Place the tortilla on a serving plate. Spread the sour cream in a 3-inch strip down the center, leaving the bottom 3 inches of tortilla bare. Top with the cheese, lettuce, salsa and turkey. Fold in the sides of the tortilla over the filling, and then fold up the bottom. Serve immediately.
