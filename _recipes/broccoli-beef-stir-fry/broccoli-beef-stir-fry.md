notes:

ingredients:
-   1| cup uncooked brown rice
-   0.5|  cups  water
-   0.5| inch  ginger  grated
-   1|  pound  flank or sirloin steak  0.25-inch thick slices
-   2.5| tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
-   1|  tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
-   1| tablespoon  cornstarch
-   2|  tablespoon  cornstarch
-   3|  cloves garlic  minced
-   0.5|  pound  brown or shitake mushrooms  sliced
-   0.75| pound  broccoli  chopped
-   2| teaspoons  rice vinegar
-   1.5|  tablespoons  tomato paste
-   0.5|  cup  chicken stock
-   0.5|  cup  water
-   2|  tablespoons  cooking oil
-   0.5|  lemon  juiced

directions:
- Prepare beef marinade by adding ginger, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 2 teaspoons cornstarch to a bowl. Add the beef slices and mix with fingers or a spatula until well combined. Set aside for at least 10 minutes. 
- Cook the brown rice by combining the rice with 2 cups of water and bringing to a boil, covered, over high heat. Once the water boils, give the rice a stir. Cover and lower the heat to low, allowing rice to simmer for about 45 minutes. 
- Heat a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add broccoli with 0.5 cup water and stir-fry until water is absorbed (the water helps the broccoli cook faster and without burning).
- Sprinkle with salt, and add mushrooms. Stir-fry until mushrooms are mostly cooked through. Remove from pan and set aside.
- Return pan to high heat. Add cooking oil and then beef to heated oil. Spread beef out into one layer if possible. Cook for 1 minute and then return broccoli and mushrooms to the pan; add garlic and stir. 
- In a separate bowl, make the stir-fry sauce by adding 2.5 tablespoons soy sauce, rice vinegar, chicken stock and 1 tablespoon cornstarch.
- Push all ingredients to the side, forming a donut in the middle of the pan. Give sauce a final stir and pour it into the hole. Let it sit until you see it darken in color and start to bubble a lot. When that happens, toss everything through. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and then season to taste with salt and pepper. Feel free to add a kick of hot sauce too. Enjoy over 0.5 cup of rice.
