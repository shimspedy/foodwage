ingredients:
- Lemon Garlic Chicken:

- 2|  tablespoon  unsalted butter
- 1|  tablespoon  1
- 1|  boneless, skinless chicken breasts  pounded thin into cutlets
- Salt and peppe
- 0.33333333333|  cup  all-purpose flour  plus 2 tablespoons
- 0.5|  cup  chicken broth
- 1|  medium  lemon juiced
- 1|  clove garlic  minced
- 1|  green onion  sliced

directions:
- Place a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1 tablespoon of the butter and oil, and swirl to coat.
- Meanwhile, sprinkle each chicken breast with salt and pepper on both sides.
- Place 1/3 cup of the flour in a shallow bowl, and dunk each chicken breast in it. Cover each side with flour, but shake off any excess.
- Place the chicken in the pan, and cook for 2–4 minutes on each side, until nice and browned. (Don’t worry too much about cooking them all the way through, but be sure to brown both sides.)
- Remove the chicken from the pan, and reduce the heat to low.
- Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of flour. Whisk together to create a roux, and let it cook for at least 1 minute.
- Next, add the chicken broth and lemon juice. Whisk to combine with the butter and flour mixture. Add the chicken back to the pan. Let it simmer, and the sauce will thicken in about a minute. Add the garlic, and simmer another 30 seconds. Sprinkle the sliced scallion on top, and then serve.
