Start on the stovetop, finish in the oven—this frittata is simple and delicious. A light mix of egg whites and egg, tender spinach and chunky potatoes makes this dish a hearty vegetarian meal for breakfast, brunch or dinner. Be sure your nonstick skillet is oven-safe. A well-seasoned cast-iron pan is perfect.
