This hearty main dish salad gets a kick from a zingy peanut dressing made with heart-healthy avocado oil and plenty of protein thanks to store-bought rotisserie chicken. Tangelos are an easy-to-peel hybrid of tangerines and grapefruit with juicy, tangy flesh. Substitute large oranges or tangerines if tangelos are unavailable.
