ingredients:
- Strawberry Cheesecake Parfaits:

- 3|  cinnamon graham crackers, crushed I used Cadia Organic Cinnamon Grahams
- 1|  teaspoon  finely grated lemon zest
- Neufchatel cheese
- 1|  container lemon low-fat yogurt
- 1|  tablespoon  honey
- 1|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- 1.5|  cup  sliced strawberries

directions:
- Place the graham crackers in a zip-top bag, seal bag and mash with a rolling pin until the crackers are reduced to fine crumbs. Mix the crumbs with the lemon zest and divide evenly between 4 small dessert glasses or jars. Set aside.
- In a medium bowl, beat the cheese, yogurt, honey and vanilla with a hand-held mixer until smooth. Spoon mixture into the glasses. Top with the strawberries and chill for 30 minutes before serving.

Creamy, yet light, these individual parfaits use the natural sweetness in strawberries to carry this dessert to deliciousness. Itâ€™s perfect for experimenting, too: use blueberries and vanilla yogurt or whatever combination strikes your fancy.
