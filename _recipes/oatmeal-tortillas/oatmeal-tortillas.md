notes:

ingredients:
- Tortillas:

- 2|  cup  Quaker Old Fashioned Oats  1|
- 0.75|  cup  warm water  0.25|

directions:
- Place the Quaker Oats in the blender and process until they are finely ground, about 1 or 2 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the ground oats, baking powder and salt, and mix well. Pour in water gradually, using your hand to mix everything together until a dough forms.
- Knead dough for about 3 minutes; the dough should be pliable, but a little bit sticky. If it feels dry and crumbly, add an extra 0.25 cup of water in small increments, and keep kneading until you’ve reached the right consistency. Cover with a moist paper towel, and let rest for a minimum of 30 minutes. (The longer you let the dough rest, the softer the tortillas will be.)
- Divide dough into 10 equal balls. Place a ball of dough into a tortilla press lined with plastic and press down. (If you do not have a tortilla press you can roll them out between two pieces of plastic wrap.) The tortilla should be as thin as possible.
- Remove the plastic from both sides and lay the tortilla on a medium-hot griddle. After about 40 seconds, you will see the edges of the tortilla dry slightly and it should easily unstick from the griddle. Flip it over and let cook for another 40 seconds. Flip again, and let cook for 40 seconds more. Transfer the tortilla to a basket or tortilla warmer lined with a kitchen towel. Press and cook the remaining tortillas. Stack each baked tortilla on top of the previous one. Keep tortillas well wrapped in the towel to keep warm.
