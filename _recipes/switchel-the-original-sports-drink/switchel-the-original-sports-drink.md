Enjoy this drink before, during or after a workout for something more flavorful than water but without any artificial colors or flavors. It’s a clever combination of simple ingredients. Maple syrup contains magnesium and potassium, which can help prevent cramps. Apple cider vinegar can quell nausea and indigestion. Ginger can also helps with nausea.

Note: Use raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar here, so you get the minerals and other good stuff.

Switchel  The drink is refreshing, mildly sweet and tangy. When made with fruit juices, it tastes surprisingly like the convenience store sports drinks. Refrigerate it overnight to allow the flavors to mellow and mingle. This recipe makes an entire pitcher; it’ll keep for a few days in the fridge.

Makes: about 4 1/4 cups (1 L)

Time: 5 minutes to prep, plus resting overnight
