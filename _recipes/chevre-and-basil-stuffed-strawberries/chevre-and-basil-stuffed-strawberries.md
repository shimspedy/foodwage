ingredients:
- Chèvre and Basil Stuffed Strawberries:

- 1|  pint  organic strawberries
- creamy chèvre (goat cheese)  room temperature
- 1|  tablespoon  finely chopped basil leaves  plus 12| small leaves for garnish
- salt and freshly ground black pepper  1| pinch each
- 0.25|  cup  shelled pistachios  finely chopped

directions:
- Wash the strawberries. Using a paring knife, hull the strawberries, creating a cone-shaped pocket in the top of each berry. Pat dry with paper towels.
- In a small bowl, blend the cheese, chopped basil, salt and pepper with a fork until combined. Spoon the cheese mixture into the bottom corner of a zip-top bag. Cut off a little of the corner of the bag to create a makeshift pastry bag. Pipe the cheese mixture into the strawberries.
- Dip the top of each berry in the chopped nuts and garnish with one of the reserved basil leaves. Serve immediately or refrigerate up to 4 hours.
