ingredients:
- Sweet Apple & Mustard Chicken:

- 0.25|  cup  whole-grain mustard  or your favorite kind of mustard
- 1|  tbsp  olive oil
- 0.25|  cup  unsweetened applesauce
- 2|  tbsp  apple cider vinegar
- 1|  tsp  honey
- 0.5|  cup  chopped parsley
- 4|  boneless, skinless chicken breast
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 0.25|  tsp  black pepper
directions:
- In a large bowl or resealable plastic bag, combine the mustard, olive oil, applesauce, vinegar, honey and parsley. Add the chicken breasts, and marinate for 20 minutes or wait overnight if desired.
- Remove the chicken from the marinade (discard the marinade). Season with salt and pepper.
- Grill the chicken breasts until cooked through or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 165°F (74°C), 4–6 minutes per side.
- If you don’t have a grill, you can bake the chicken breasts. Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). Bake the chicken for 30–40 minutes, until the chicken is completely cooked through and opaque.

Make juicy chicken breasts with this recipe for sweet apple and mustard marinade. Lean chicken breast sits in the acidic mixture, which helps keep moisture in when you start grilling. Make a batch of these chicken breasts and reheat it for dinner, or use in a sandwich for lunch.
