notes:

ingredients:
- Granola Bars:

- 7|  large pitted medjool dates  soaked, (about 1/2 cup packed)
- 5| tablespoons  hot water
- 0.5| cup natural peanut butter  with salt
- 3|  tablespoons  brown rice syrup  certified gluten-free if necessary; can also substitute with honey
- 1|  vanilla extract
- 2|  cups  old-fashioned oats  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 0.25| cup  chia seeds  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 2|  tablespoons ground flaxseed  certified gluten-free if necessary
directions:
- Line a shallow baking dish with parchment paper (or wax paper). I used a 7 inch x 11 inch glass dish.
- Place pitted dates in a bowl. Cover the dates with boiling or very hot water (I used my tea kettle) until full submerged. Allow them to soak for at least 10 minutes.
- Strain the soaked dates and place them plus 5 tablespoons of water in a blender. Blend until combined. The mixture will be very thick.
- Place date mixture, peanut butter, brown rice syrup, and vanilla in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until well-combined and heated through.
- In a large bowl, combine oats, chia seeds, and flax. Stir in wet mixture until combined.
- Spoon mixture into the baking dish, pressing very firmly so mixture is evenly spread throughout pan. It should be very compact. Place another piece of parchment paper on top and press down firmly. Remove top piece of parchment and freeze bars for at least 2 hours.
- Cut into 12 bars. Store in the freezer.
