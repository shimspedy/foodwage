notes:


ingredients:
- beef and tomato sauce:
- 2| tablespoons Olive Oil
- 1| medium Brown Onion  diced
- 1| teaspoon Salt
- 1| teaspoon Ghee
- 1.1|  pound  95% lean ground Beef
- 0.66| cup dry Red Wine
- 3| cloves  Garlic  finely diced chopped
- 0.66| teaspoon Black Pepper
- 0.66| teaspoon Sweet Paprika
- 3| cups  Tomato Passata

- lasagna layers:
- 1| Parsnip (approx. 9 inches long), peeled and sliced thinly
- 1|  large Eggplant  (approx. 1 1/4 pound), sliced into 1 cm-thick disks (1/2 inch)
- 1| teaspoon  Salt
- 2| tablespoons Olive Oil
- 2| tablespoons Ghee
- 0.5| cup fresh Basil leaves  torn
- 5| Button Mushrooms  sliced
- 2| cups baby Spinach leaves
- 3| medium Zucchini  sliced vertically into thin ribbons

- No-Pasta Lasagna:
- 1.5| cups Ricotta Cheese
- 2 or 3| tbsp grated Parmesan Cheese
- 20| cherry Tomatoes  halved

directions:
- To prep the parsnip layers:
- Heat oven to 180°C (355°F). Place a layer of parsnip slices with a little ghee in a deep lasagna tray and pre-bake in the oven for 15 minutes, this will help to soften them slightly before we build the rest of the layers. Set aside.
- To make the meat sauce:
- Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil and sauté onion with a pinch of salt for 5-8 minutes, until slightly caramelized. Add 1 tsp of ghee and bring the heat up to high.
- Break the beef mince and add to the frying pan. Use a spatula or a potato masher (my little trick) to stir and break the mince apart into small pieces, as it tends to clump together during cooking. Cook for about 5–6 minutes, until browned.
- Add red wine, garlic, pepper, paprika and salt to cooking meat and stir for 3-4 minutes. Add tomato passata, bring to boil and turn the heat down to simmering temperature. Simmer for 10 minutes.
- To prep the eggplant layers:
- Meanwhile, sprinkle eggplant slices with salt and set aside for 10 minutes to draw out some of the juices. Rinse and pat dry. Heat the oven back to 180°C (355°F).
- In another frying pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp ghee. Fry the eggplant in batches for 2-3 minutes on each side, until light golden brown. Add more olive oil and ghee as you go along. Set aside, by this stage all our layer ingredients should be ready.
- To assemble the lasagna:
- Take the baking tray out of the oven and start layering the lasagna in this order from bottom to top  parsnip slices, 1/3 of tomato meat sauce, eggplant slices, fresh basil leaves, mushrooms, remaining meat sauce, baby spinach and zucchini slices. Drizzle olive oil and cracked black pepper if desired.
- To cook the lasagna:
- Cook in the oven, at 180°C (355°F), for 35–40 minutes. If using ricotta and grated Parmesan cheese, add on top of the lasagna at the 20 minutes cooking-time mark. Increase the heat to 200°C (390°F) for the last 10–15 minutes
- Garnish with fresh basil and a few cherry tomatoes. Serve with a side mixed salad.
