notes:

ingredients:
- Hot Wings:

- 2|  lbs  Chicken Wings  2|
- 0.5|  tsp  Salt  0.25|
- 0.5|  cup  100% Pomegranate Juice  1|
- 2|  tsp  Honey  1.5|
- 1|  tsp  Sriracha  1.5|
directions:
- Pour 1 cup of water into an electric pressure cooker. Place a steaming basket in the pot.
- Toss the wings with the garlic, salt and pepper and place them in the steaming basket. Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes. Quick-release the pressure.
- While the wings cook, make the glaze. In a small saucepan, whisk together the juice, mustard, honey, vinegar and Sriracha. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until thickened slightly, 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 teaspoons of water and add to the pan. Cook until thickened and bubbly, 1 minute. Remove from heat.
- Place oven rack 4 inches below the broiler element and preheat oven to broil. Line a baking sheet with foil and coat lightly with cooking spray. Toss the wings in the pomegranate mixture and arrange on the prepared baking sheet in an even layer. Pour any remaining sauce over the wings. Broil until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Flip wings and broil for an additional 3 minutes or until browned on second side. Serve immediately.

Cooking wings in the Instant Pot yields fall-off-the-bone chicken in just 5 minutes and renders off some of the fat. Glazed with a sweet-spicy blend of antioxidant-rich pomegranate juice, honey and Sriracha instead of traditional hot sauce, these are a delicious (and much healthier) alternative to old-school deep-fried wings.
