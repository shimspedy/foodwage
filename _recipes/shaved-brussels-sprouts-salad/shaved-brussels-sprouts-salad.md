time: under 18 mins
servings: 5

notes:


ingredients:
- dressing:

- 3| tablespoons Walnut Oil
- 1| tablespoon Lemon Zest
- 3| tablespoons Lemon Juice
- 2| tablespoons Apple Cider Vinegar
- 2| teaspoons stone ground Mustard
- 0.25| teaspoon Salt

- salad:

- 0.5| cup Walnuts
- 5| cups Brussels Sprouts  shaved
- 1| medium Fuji Apple  cored and chopped
- 0.5| cup Red Onion
- 0.5| cup Blueberries
- 1| medium Avocado  diced
- 0.25| Feta Cheese  Optional garnish

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F. Spread walnuts on a cookie sheet and bake until they have some color to them and are fragrant, about 5 to 8 minutes. Allow walnuts to cool enough to chop.
- In a large salad bowl or mixing bowl, whisk together the walnut oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, cider vinegar, mustard and salt until smooth.
- Wash the Brussels sprouts, chop off all of the hard stems and remove the leaves that fall off easily. Slice Brussels sprouts from tip-to-tail (not length-wise). Stop slicing once you get to the hard white part – this part you can either discard or chop finely. Using your hands, break apart any slices of sprouts that are stuck together (this can usually be achieved by simply tossing the shaved Brussels sprouts)
- Add shaved Brussels sprouts to the bowl with the dressing and toss together until Brussels are completely coated. Add the remaining ingredients and toss together.
- Serve as a side salad for a delicious and healthy meal!

The poor and misunderstood Brussels sprout, once the “most hated vegetable in America,”is now making a come back! So how do we show this vegetable a little love? By making Food Fanatic’s zesty shaved Brussels sprouts salad, of course. Speaking of love, this dish also marries together heart-healthy ingredients like walnuts, blueberries and avocados. Fun fact: Brussels sprouts packs plenty of glucosinolates, which has antioxidant and anti-carcinogenic effects.
