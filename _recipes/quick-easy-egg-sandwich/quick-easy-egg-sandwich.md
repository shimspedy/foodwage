- Quick & Easy Egg Sandwich:

- 4|  large  eggs
- 4|  whole wheat English muffins
- 4|  slices  cheddar cheese
- 1|  medium avocado  sliced into 8 wedges
directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, and use cooking oil to lightly grease 4 wells in a muffin tin. Crack 1 egg into each muffin cup. Bake the eggs for 15-20 minutes.
- While the eggs are cooling, slice the English muffins in half. Toast them in a toaster oven. If you donâ€™t have a toaster oven, toast muffins in a non-stick pan over medium heat until both sides are crispy. Set muffins aside.
- Build your sandwich by topping one slice of English muffin with 1 egg, 2 avocado wedges and 1 slice of cheese. Place top on English muffin. If you prefer, you can warm the sandwich in the microwave for 20 seconds to melt the cheese.
