notes:
- If you’re making more than one dalgona, keep a pot of hot water boiling on the stove. As you make each batch, rinse off the ladle and scraper in a quick dip in the pot before proceeding onward to the next batch. Wipe out any drips with a dry towel and you’re ready to go!
- After cooling your dalgona, store them in a ziplock bag in a cool and dry place, for up to 3 days. Refrigeration is recommended if you are in a warmer climate.
- Storage in humid environments or hot climates may lead to the dalgona becoming sticky and start developing mini craters.


ingredients:

- 2| tbsp granulated sugar
- Pinch baking soda
- Cooking spray

directions:
- Add the sugar to a ladle and then hold it over low heat. Stir around the sugar with a chopstick from time to time until it starts to melt. The sugar will start to melt around the edges first and it usually takes about 1 minute to reach this point. Once this happens, start stirring more vigorously.
- You also need to control the heat, by lifting the ladle off or moving it closer to your heat source. It will take about 3-4 minutes to completely liquidize; it should end up smooth with no lumps. 
- Bring the ladle to the side of the stove (no heat area), and slowly and carefully add a pinch of baking soda. Make sure you don’t add too much, as it can burn quickly and make the dalgona taste bitter. Stir quickly and thoroughly until the baking soda is fully dissolved; You will see the mixture turning into a light caramel-color. While stirring, bring the ladle closer to the heat for 3 to 5 seconds to give the mixture a fluffy and airy texture while keeping it warm.
- Pour the melted sugar mixture onto a baking sheet covered with a silicone mat or baking paper, scraping with a silicone spatula.
- Let it cool for about 45 seconds, then lightly tap with a silicone spatula to see if the dalgona sticks to it. If it doesn’t, press down the dalgona using a hotteok press for 4 to 5 seconds to flatten it. You can use any smooth, flat, non-stick object like a small stainless steel pot to press it down.
- To create a pattern in the candy, press a cookie cutter into the middle of the candy and remove it quickly. If you press hard and firmly, your pattern will come out easier - but if you press lightly, it will be difficult to get the pattern out. Quickly remove the cookie cutter.
- Let the dalgona candy cool for about one minute or until it hardens. Serve.
