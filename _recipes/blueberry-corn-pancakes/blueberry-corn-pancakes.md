ingredients:
- Pancakes:

- 1.5| cups  fresh blueberries
- 2| tablespoons  maple syrup
- 0.25| teaspoon  ground cinnamon
- 1| teaspoon  lemon juice
- 0.5| cup  fine yellow cornmeal
- 0.25| cup  whole- wheat pastry flour  or gluten-free flour blend
- 1.5| teaspoons  g
- 1| teaspoon  baking powder
- 0.25| teaspoon  salt
- 0.5| cup  2% milk
- 1|  egg  beaten
- 1.5| tablespoon  melted coconut oil  or safflower oil
directions:
- In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup (170g) of the blueberries, syrup, cinnamon and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer over medium low heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the blueberries have popped and released their juices and the mixture is syrupy, 4 minutes. Keep warm over low heat.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, egg and oil. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Add the blueberries and stir until combined.
- Mist a non-stick pan with cooking spray and heat over medium heat until hot. Scoop the batter into a 0.25|-cup measure and pour into the pan. Repeat with remaining batter in 2 batches, spacing the pancakes a few inches apart. Flip the pancakes when the edges look dry and the bottoms are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Adjust heat as necessary. Cook on the second side until cooked through. Serve with the blueberry syrup.

If you choose to skip maple syrup, the homemade blueberry syrup adds the sweetness you want while packing in some extra fiber and antioxidants from the blueberries. Opting for a gluten-free flour blend make these ideal for a GF breakfast.
