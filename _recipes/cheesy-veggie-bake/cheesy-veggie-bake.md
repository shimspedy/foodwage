notes:


ingredients:
- Cheesy Veggie Bake:

- 4|  large  zucchini squashes
- salt
- 4|  large  eggs
- 1|  cup  egg whites  about 8 large egg whites
- 0.5|  cup  fat-free plain greek yogurt  certified gluten-free if necessary
- Black pepper
- 2|  cups  broccoli  chopped into bite sized pieces
- 2|  cup  kale  orn and lightly packed
- 1.5|  cup  reduced-fat shredded cheddar cheese  divided

directions:
- Preheat your oven to 350°F and spray a 10-inch Cast Iron skillet with cooking spray. Set aside.
- Using the 6mm blade on your spiralizer. Spiralize the zucchinis, so that they turn into long noodles.
- Place the zucchini into a strainer set over a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Let them sit for 20 minutes, stirring around every so often.
- While the zucchini noodles sit, whisk together the eggs and egg whites in a large bowl. Add in the Greek yogurt and a pinch of pepper and additional salt. Whisk until smooth and creamy.
- Once the zucchini has sat, squeeze out as much excess water as you can. Then, transfer the zucchini noodles onto a paper towel and dry off, again, as much as you can.
- Stir the zucchini noodles, broccoli, kale and 1 cup of the cheddar cheese into the egg mixture and mix well.
- Pour the mixture into the prepared skillet and spread out evenly. Sprinkle with remaining cheddar cheese.
- Bake until the eggs feel set and begin to slightly pull away from the side of the skillet, about 40-45 minutes. Turn your oven to high broil and broil an additional 2-3 minutes or until the top turns golden brown.
