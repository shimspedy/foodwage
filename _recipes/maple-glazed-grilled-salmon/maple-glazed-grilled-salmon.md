chef: foodwage
time: under 10 mins
servings: 4

notes:
- The key to a perfect crisp is a sparing amount of cooking spray so that extra fat doesn’t absorb into the quesadilla.

ingredients:
- Salmon:

- 2|  tablespoons  pure Maple Syrup
- 3|  tablespoons  dark Balsamic Vinegar
- 2|  fillets  raw Salmon about 140g each (the skin-on type should hold up better on the BBQ)
- to taste  Sea Salt
- to taste  Black Pepper
- 1|  tablespoon  Olive Oil

directions:
- Combine balsamic vinegar and maple syrup in a resealable bag. Seal the salmon fillets in the bag and marinate for at least 10 minutes (or longer, if you have time) while you prepare the grill.
- Lightly oil the grill, then preheat to medium-high.
- Transfer the salmon fillets from the bag to a plate, pouring remaining marinade over the filet. Sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper, then place filets skin-side up on the grill for 2 minutes. Flip the salmon (skin-side down) and grill until cooked, about 6 minutes depending on the thickness of the filet.
- Serve with brown rice or quinoa, a side salad, or sauteed veggies if desired.
