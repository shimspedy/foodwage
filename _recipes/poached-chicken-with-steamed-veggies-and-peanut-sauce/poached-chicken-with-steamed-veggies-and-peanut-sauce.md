- 0.5|  cup  light coconut milk, well stirred  plus 1 tablespoon
- 4.5|  tablespoons  all-natural peanut butter  such as Adams

- 1.5|  teaspoon  packed brown sugar
- 1.5|  teaspoon  Thai red curry paste
- 0.5|  teaspoon  turmeric
- 1.5| inches fresh ginger  thinly sliced
- 0.75|  teaspoon  salt

- 1|  lime  cut into wedges

directions:
- In a small saucepan, whisk together coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, curry paste and turmeric and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cover and set aside.
- In a medium saucepan, combine 3.5 cups of water, ginger slices and salt. Fit a metal steamer basket into the pan. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove the lid and place the carrots, broccoli and green beans in layers, in that order, in the steamer basket. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and steam the vegetables until crisp-tender, 6–8 minutes. Remove the steamer basket from the pan and transfer the vegetables to a serving bowl, cover loosely with foil and set aside.

Steaming vegetables brings out their vibrant colors and true flavors. The ginger-infused steaming water doubles as a poaching liquid for the chicken and a simple, five-ingredient peanut sauce ties everything together. If you can’t find chicken tenders, cut boneless skinless chicken breasts horizontally into 0.5 inch thick pieces.
