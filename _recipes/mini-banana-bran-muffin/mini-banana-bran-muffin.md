notes:


ingredients:
- Mini Banana Bran Muffin:

- 1|  cup  unprocessed wheat bran
- 1|  cup  all-purpose flour
- 0.25|  cup  brown sugar  firmly packed light
- 2|  teaspoon  baking powder
- 1|  teaspoon  ground cinnamon
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 2|  large  eggs  50 grams each
- 1|  cup  skim (1%) milk
- 1|  medium  ripe banana  about 1/3 cup mashed
- 0.25|  cup  light molasses
- 1|  teaspoon  vanilla extract

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray 32 mini-muffin cups with cooking spray or line mini muffin pan with paper liners then spray with cooking spray (NOTE: These protein and fiber rich muffins are made without added fat so they will stick to paper liners that are not sprayed with cooking spray.)
- Combine wheat bran, flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.
- Beat together eggs, milk, banana, molasses, and vanilla in a medium bowl. Add egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir just until moistened.
- Spoon 1 tablespoon batter evenly into prepared muffin cups. Bake 10 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffin comes out clean. Cool muffins in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove from pan; serve warm or room temperature.
