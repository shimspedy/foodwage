notes:


ingredients:
- Garlicky Broccoli ‘Zoodles’ with Bacon:

- 3|  large  broccoli crowns with stems
- 6|  slices  bacon
- 2|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 0.25|  teaspoon  crushed red pepper
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 5|  cloves garlic  thinly sliced
- 1|  lemon, zested and juiced
- 3|  tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese

directions:
- Slice off the broccoli florets, taking as little stem as possible, and set aside. Then spiralize the stems into linguine.
- Fill a large saucepan halfway with salted water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli florets and noodles. Cook for 2–3 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain and pat dry.
- Place a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. When water flicked onto the skillet sizzles, add the bacon slices in an even layer, working in batches if needed. Cook for 3 minutes per side, or until browned and crisped to your liking. Set aside to drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
- Wipe out the skillet, return it to medium heat, and add the olive oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the broccoli florets, broccoli noodles and crushed red pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook for 2 minutes, uncovering occasionally to toss. Add the garlic, half the lemon zest and the juice. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes, or until the broccoli is lightly browned.
- Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the cheese. Toss to combine and serve warm.
