ingredients:
- Hasselback Chicken Caprese With Fennel:

- 1|  cup  basil leaves  loosely packed
- 3|  tbsp  olive oil  divided
- 1|  tbsp  lemon juice
- 2|  medium  garlic cloves
- 1|  tsp  salt
- 4|  small  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 5|  medium  campari tomatoes sliced
- part-skim mozzarella,  thinly sliced
- 2|  medium  fennel bulbs
- 0.5|  tsp  pepper
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with foil and coat with cooking spray. In a blender, combine the basil, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and 0.25 teaspoon salt; blend until smooth.
- Make vertical cuts every 0.5 inch (1.3cm) in the chicken breasts, not cutting all the way through the meat to create pockets. Fill each pocket with a slice of tomato and cheese. Spoon the basil mixture into the pockets. Sprinkle the chicken with 0.5 teaspoon of the salt and pepper and place on the prepared baking sheet.
- Cut the fennel lengthwise into 0.5 inch (1.3cm) slices through the root end. Brush the fennel with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, season with remaining 0.25 teaspoon salt and arrange on the baking sheet around the chicken. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink in the center (an instant read thermometer will register 165°F/74°C), about 20 minutes. Serve the chicken with the fennel on the side.

Low-carb, high-protein and a good source of veggies, this sheet pan supper is a riff on hasselback potatoes, but it’s chicken stuffed with heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella and quick homemade pesto. We roast sliced fennel on the same baking pan, but you could also use broccoli or cauliflower florets.
