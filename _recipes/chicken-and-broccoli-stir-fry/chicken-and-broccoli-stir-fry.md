ingredients:
- Chicken and Broccoli Stir-Fry:

- 2| tbsp low-sodium soy sauce or tamari
- 1| tbsp oyster sauce
- 1| tbsp rice vinegar
- 1| tbsp brown sugar
- 1| tbsp sesame oil
- 2| tsp cornstarch
- boneless skinless chicken thighs excess fat trimmed and meat cut into 1-inch (2.5cm) pieces
- Kosher salt, to taste
- 1.5| tbsp grapeseed or canola oil
- 1| large head broccoli cut into small florets and stalk peeled and sliced 0.25|-inch thick
- 1| medium shallot , thinly sliced
- 2| inch peeled and julienned fresh ginger
- 0.5| Fresno pepper, thinly sliced seeds discarded if sensitive to heat
- 1| cup lightly packed basil leaves
- Torn basil leaves Optional for serving
- Steamed brown rice Optional for serving
- Lime wedges Optional for serving

directions:
- In a medium bowl, whisk the low-sodium soy sauce with the oyster sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, sesame oil, cornstarch and 0.25 cup (60ml) water. Set aside.
- Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt. In a 12-inch skillet or wok, heat the grapeseed oil until shimmering. Add the chicken and cook over high heat, stirring once, until browned, 2–4 minutes.
- Add the broccoli, shallot, ginger and Fresno pepper. Cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the broccoli is crisp-tender, 3–5 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chicken and broccoli and cook, stirring, until the sauce begins to thicken, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and fold in the basil.
- Divide between four shallow bowls and garnish with torn basil leaves. Serve immediately with steamed brown rice and lime wedges.

This stir-fry is not your average take-out: A generous amount of basil, fresh ginger and the sharp heat of Fresno pepper make it bright and fragrant. If you do not have a 12-inch skillet or wok, then sear your chicken thighs in two batches. Crowding the pan prevents the chicken from browning. This stir-fry comes together quickly, so stay close to your stove. Luckily, chicken thighs are quite forgiving, but you want your broccoli to be vibrant green and crisp-tender.
