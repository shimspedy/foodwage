ingredients:
- Slow Cooker Black Bean Soup:

- 1|  pound  dried black beans, sorted and rinsed
- large  onion, coarsely chopped
- 1|  medium  green bell pepper, coarsely chopped
- 3|  garlic cloves, minced
- 4|  cup  vegetable broth
- 1|  tablespoon  ground cumin
- 2|  teaspoon  chopped chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
- 3|  tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
- 2|  tablespoon  fresh lime juice
- 1|  teaspoon  salt
- 6|  teaspoon  light sour cream
- 0.75|  cup  avocado, diced
- 6|  fresh cilantro sprigs for garnish  optional

directions:
- Pace beans in a large bowl or stock pot, adding water to cover by 2 inches. Soak for 12 hours; drain and discard water.
- TIME-SAVING TIP: Donâ€™t have 12 hours? To quick-soak beans, place beans in a stock pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat and simmer briskly for 5 minutes. Remove from heat; cover and let soak 1 hour. Drain and discard water.
- Combine beans, onion, bell pepper and garlic in 4-quart slow cooker. Stir in broth and cumin. Cover and cook on low for 10 hours until beans are tender. Stir in chipotle, cilantro, lime juice and salt.
- For a smooth, thick texture, blend mixture in slow cooker with an immersion blender for 30 seconds until desired consistency. Or, transfer in batches to a blender. Remove stopper in lid and cover with a kitchen towel (hot steam will cause the lid to pop off if not vented); blend until smooth.
- Top each serving with 1 teaspoon sour cream, 2 tablespoons chopped avocado and a sprig of cilantro.
