ingredients:
- Egg & Toast Cups:

- 6|  slice  whole-wheat bread
- 1|  tablespoon  unsalted butter  melted
- 0.25|  cup  shredded, reduced-fat cheddar cheese
- 0.25|  cup  tomato  finely chopped
- 6|  large  egg
- 0.25|  teaspoon  kosher salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
- 2|  slice  bacon  cooked and crumbled
- 1|  tablespoon  chopped fresh chives  optional

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F.
- Flatten each bread slice with a rolling pin until very thin. Trim crusts off bread. Lightly brush both sides of bread slices with melted butter. Cut each bread slice in half diagonally.
- With cut sides facing, place 2 bread halves in each of 6 muffin cups, making sure to cover bottom entirely and allowing bread corners to extend above rims. Bake at 375°F for 5 minutes or until bread is slightly firm. Remove pan from oven; sprinkle 2 teaspoons shredded cheese into each cup. Top each cup with 2 teaspoons chopped tomato. Crack 1 egg into each cup; sprinkle eggs evenly with salt and pepper. Bake an additional 18 minutes or until whites are set and yolks are still a bit runny or to desired degree of doneness. Remove egg cups from pan; sprinkle evenly with bacon and chives, if desired.
