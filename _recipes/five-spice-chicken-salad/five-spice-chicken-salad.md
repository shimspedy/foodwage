Flavor-packed chicken breast served over a bed of crunchy greens makes for a great summer salad. The main star in this recipe is five-spice powder, a mix frequently used in Chinese cuisine, which brings a warm, spicy-sweet flavor to dishes. Add cooling cucumber, carrots, radishes and a drizzle of honey lime vinaigrette.
