Just set-it-and-forget-it! So goes the appeal of the slow cooker and, lucky for us, it’s making a comeback. The Healthy Maven’s recipe for jerk chicken bathes chicken drumsticks in a flavorful jerk spice, slow cooks it for 4 hours and quick-broils it for added extra crisp. Imagine coming home to that meal! This dish pairs well with rice, beans and/or a side salad for a complete meal.
