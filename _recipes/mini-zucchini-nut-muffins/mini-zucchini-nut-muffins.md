Dietitian Debbie Dishes‘ muffins are lightly sweetened, deliver some heart-healthy omega-3 fats from the ground flaxseeds and walnuts, and are vegan to boot! These mini-muffins are great to have on hand for a grab-n-go snack. Make it time-convenient by keeping a stash in your freezer, and toast one as you change before heading out the door. Pair with a banana and a cup of yogurt for a filling breakfast!
