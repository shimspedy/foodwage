servings: 4

ingredients:
- 4|  boneless, skinless chicken breasts, pounded into 1/2-inch thickness
- 0.5|  cup  whole-wheat flour, divided  plus 1 tablespoon
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.5|  teaspoon  fresh ground black pepper
- 1|  large  egg
- 1|  cup  whole-wheat panko bread crumbs
- 2|  teaspoon  minced fresh sage leaves
- 2|  teaspoon  olive oil, divided
- 1|  tablespoon  minced garlic
- 1|  small  red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- 0.5|  cup  low-sodium chicken broth
- 1|  bunch  collard greens, ribs removed and leaves chopped  about 4 cups or 145 grams
- 0.5|  cup  low-sodium canned cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- Pinch red pepper flakes  to taste

directions:
- Dredge chicken through flour mixture, shaking off any excess.
- Combine salt, pepper, and egg. Dredge through egg mixture, shaking off excess.
- Combine panko and sage. Dredge through panko mixture, gently pressing panko onto chicken. Transfer chicken to a large plate.
- Line a separate large plate with paper towel and set aside. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil on medium-high. Working in batches if necessary, add chicken to skillet and cook, turning once, for 4 to 6 minutes per side, or until cooked through and no longer pink in center. Transfer to paper towel–lined plate. Cover with foil and set aside.
- Return skillet to medium-high. Add garlic and bell pepper and sauté, stirring frequently, for 1 to 2 minutes, until softened. Sprinkle remaining 1 tbsp flour over top and stir quickly. Stir in broth and bring to a boil. Cook for 1 minute, until liquid is slightly thickened. Reduce heat to a simmer. Working in batches, add collard greens, about 2 cups per batch, cooking each batch until slightly wilted. Add beans, stir to combine and cook until heated through. Season with pepper flakes and toss to combine; remove from heat.
- Spoon greens-beans mixture onto serving plates and top with chicken, dividing evenly.
