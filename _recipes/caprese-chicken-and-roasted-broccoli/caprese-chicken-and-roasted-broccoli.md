ingredients:
- 2|  skinless, boneless chicken breasts  6 ounces each
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  pepper
- 1.5|  pounds  broccoli  chopped
- 2|  cloves garlic  minced
- 1|  Roma tomato  sliced
- 2|  sprigs  basil  leaves thinly chopped
- 4|  slices  fresh mozzarella  1 ounce or 28 grams per slice
- 2|  tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

- 2|  brown sugar
- 3|  tablespoons  olive oil

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C)  
- Slice the chicken breasts in half and then season and tenderize with salt and pepper. Set aside.
- Whisk together balsamic vinegar, mustard, brown sugar and olive oil. Toss half with the broccoli and spread out onto a sheet pan. Sprinkle with salt and roast for 25 minutes, shaking midway.   
- Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush with some oil and then grill chicken on both sides for about 2 minutes (If grill pan isnâ€™t large enough to fit all the chicken pieces, transfer grilled pieces to a sheet pan). Transfer chicken to the oven and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes. In the last 2 minutes of cooking, add a slice of mozzarella to each chicken breast.
- When chicken is done, top cheese with a basil leaf and tomato slice. Drizzle with rest of the sauce, and enjoy with your crunchy, roasted broccoli.
