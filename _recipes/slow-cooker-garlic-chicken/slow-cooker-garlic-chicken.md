ingredients:
- Slow Cooker Garlic Chicken:

- 0.5|  cup  fat-free, low-sodium chicken broth  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 3|  tablespoon  dry white wine
- 2|  tablespoon  cognac
- 1|  whole chicken  skinned and cut into 8 pieces
- 1.5|  teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
- 1.5|  teaspoon  butter
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.125|  teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
- 40|  garlic cloves  peeled and about 4 whole heads
- 2|  teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
- 4|  teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley  optional

directions:
- Combine first 3 ingredients in a small bowl.
- Discard giblets and neck from chicken. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Heat oil and butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until butter melts. Sprinkle chicken pieces evenly with salt and pepper. Add chicken pieces to pan; cook 2 1/2 minutes on each side or until golden. Remove chicken from pan; place in a 4-quart electric slow cooker.
- Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic to drippings in pan; sauté 1 minute or until garlic begins to brown. Stir in broth mixture, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Boil 2 minutes or until sauce is reduced to about 1 cup. Pour sauce over chicken; sprinkle with thyme. Cover and cook on LOW for 4 hours or until chicken is done. Serve sauce and garlic with chicken. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.

Cooking Light‘s pan-fried garlic chicken is slow-cooked to perfection in wine, cognac, and thyme. Don’t let those slow-cooked, creamy cloves of garlic go to waste — spread it on chunks of crusty French baguette or mix into brown rice and soak up the fabulous sauce as you enjoy every morsel of this super-tender chicken. Cut down on time by substituting the whole chicken for 3 pounds of pre-cut chicken pieces, and using pre-peeled garlic cloves.
