- For the lettuce wraps:

- 20|  medium-to-large lettuce leaves

directions:
- Wash the bulgur in a bowl of cold water and carefully drain the water. Repeat two more times to remove as much of the bran (it floats to the top) as you can.
- Add cold water to completely cover the bulgur, allowing it to soak for 15 minutes.
- Drain the bulgur using a mesh strainer, pressing to remove as much water as possible. Return bulgur to a dry bowl and stir in the lemon juice. Let bulgur stand for 30 minutes until tender.
- Meanwhile, toss the chicken tenders with salt, pepper, olive oil, garlic powder and Italian seasoning.
- Coat a cast-iron skillet with cooking spray and cook chicken in the pan over medium heat until browned. Cool before cubing.
- Add tomatoes, cucumber, green onion, parsley and oil to the bulgur. Mix until well combined then sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste.
- Scoop filling and chicken into your lettuce wraps and enjoy

Bulgar is a whole grain that provides about 7 grams of fiber per 0.25 cup serving. Here, itâ€™s mixed with bright cherry tomatoes, zesty lemon juice and chicken to create a hearty, protein-rich filling for lettuce wraps. You can make an extra batch and store it in the fridge to have a healthy lunch easily available.
