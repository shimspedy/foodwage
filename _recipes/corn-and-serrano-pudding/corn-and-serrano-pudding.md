time: under 1hour 15 mins
servings: 7

notes:
- If you are looking for less heat, halve the serrano lengthwise and remove the stem and seeds. Then, mince and add to the corn mixture as instructed. If you cannot find a serrano at your grocery store, use half of a small jalapeño

ingredients:
- Corn and Serrano Pudding:

- 5|  large eggs
- 0.25|  cup  2% Greek yogurt
- 0.25|  cup  agave syrup or light honey
- 1|  tsp  freshly grated lime zest
- 3.5|  cup  fresh corn kernels  (from about 5 ears) or one 32-ounce (900g) bag frozen corn kernels
- 0.75|  cup  crumbled cotija or feta cheese
- 0.5|  cup  cilantro leaves  chopped
- 1|  small serrano pepper  thinly sliced
- 2|  tsp  kosher salt
- 0.5|  tsp  freshly ground black pepper

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and grease a 2-quart baking dish.
- In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the yogurt, agave and lime zest. Fold in the corn, cheese, cilantro, serrano, salt and pepper. Scrape the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top. Bake the corn pudding for about 1 hour or until the middle is set and the top is beginning to brown.

Unlike the bready corn pudding you might be used to, this lighter version, studded with a generous amount of sweet corn, is more similar to a custard. Eggs and yogurt make a simple base, giving you a creamier result (and a gluten-free alternative). This recipe also has a spicy kick from a thinly sliced serrano pepper — it will remind you of Mexican street corn (elote asado). To round it all out, there is also fresh cilantro, a bit of punchy lime zest and salty queso fresco. This dish is best if you can get your hands on some fresh corn, but frozen will also suffice.
