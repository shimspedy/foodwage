servings: 6 

ingredients:
- 2| racks Baby Back ribs
- Dry Rib Rub:
- 1| Tbsp Lawry's seasoned salt
- 1| tsp pepper
- 1| tsp paprika
- 1| tsp garlic powder
- 0.25| tsp cayanne pepper, optional
- Tangy BBQ Sauce:
- 1| cup Ketchup
- 1| cup apple cider vinegar
- 0.33| cup honey
- 1| tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
- 0.5| teaspoon salt
- 0.25| teaspoon garlic powder
- 0.5| teaspoon onion powder
- 0.5| teaspoon cayenne pepper

directions:
- Turn on grill to medium-low , about 275Â°.  
- Rinse ribs and pat dry with a paper towel.  Remove membrane on back of each rack of ribs.  Slide a knife in at top under membrane and use your fingers to pull away.  Then use a dry paper towel to hold membrane and pull it all of the way back and remove completely. 
- In a small bowl mix seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and cayenne and mix well.  Then sprinkle generously over both sides of ribs.  Using your fingers rub the spice rub into ribs to coat well.
- Using the off-heat method cook ribs. If your grill has five burners, turn on the outer 2 burners, and leave off the three middle ones. If you only have 4 burners, then turn on two on one side, and leave the other two off. 
- You will place the ribs bone side down onto the non flame area of the grill. *No need to flip them during grilling*.
- Place ribs meaty side up on the grates over the burners that are OFF. 
- Close the lid, and check the ribs periodically to make sure they aren't burning at the point where the tips may be over a burner with a flame. As the ribs are cooking they will start to shrink a little, so if they are slightly over the flames, as they cook, move them away from the flame.
- Cook the ribs for 3--3 1/2 hours until the meat is browned and tender. You can either brush the bbq sauce on in the last 15 minutes or let your guests decide if they want BBQ sauce and have them apply it themselves. *these ribs are very good with just the rub!* . 
- While the ribs are grilling, place all ingredients for the tangy BBQ sauce in a small sauce pan and stir to mix completely.  Once mixed together, turn on heat to high to bring to a boil.  Once the sauce is at a boil reduce heat to medium and continue to cook for 30 minutes until slightly thickened.  Serve brushed on the ribs or as a side to be applied as needed.
