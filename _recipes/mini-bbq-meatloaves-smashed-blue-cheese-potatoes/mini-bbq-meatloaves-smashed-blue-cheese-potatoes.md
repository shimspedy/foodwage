ingredients:
- Mini BBQ Meatloaves & Smashed Blue Cheese Potatoes:

- small red potatoes  halved
- 0.25|  cup  low-fat buttermilk
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- crumbled blue cheese
- Cooking spray
- mild turkey Italian sausage  casings removed
- 9| lean ground sirloin
- 0.5|  cup  grated carrot
- 0.25|  cup  thinly sliced green onions
- 0.25|  cup  whole-wheat panko  Japanese breadcrumbs
- 0.5|  teaspoon  black pepper
- 1|  large egg  lightly beaten
- 0.33333333333|  cup  reduced-sodium barbecue sauce

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F.
- Place potatoes in a medium saucepan filled with water. Bring to a boil; cook 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain. Return potatoes to pan.
- Add buttermilk, salt and cheese; mash with a potato masher to desired consistency. Keep warm.
- Coat 8 muffin cups with cooking spray. Combine sausage, sirloin, carrot, green onions, panko, black pepper and egg in a large bowl, stirring just until combined.
- Divide sausage mixture evenly among prepared cups. Make a 1/2-inch-deep indentation in the center of each meatloaf. (This keeps the proteins from shrinking too much, which could result in a dense, dry meatloaf.)
- Top each meat loaf with about 2 teaspoons barbecue sauce.
- Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 160°F.
