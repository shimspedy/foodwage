This dish features hearty black beans, cooked spinach, shredded cheese and tomatoes all rolled into a warm tortilla blanket. In addition to being high in fiber and vegetarian friendly, taquitos are also super flexible. If you don’t like black bean and spinach here are some good options: Switch up the filling with shredded rotisserie chicken, sautéed onions or other greens.
