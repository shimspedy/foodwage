notes:

ingredients:
- Pina Colada Popsicles with Chocolate-Coconut Shells:

- 1|  can  coconut milk
- 1| cup  fresh ripe pineapple chunks
- 1|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- 0.5|  cup  dark chocolate  chopped
- 1.5|  teaspoon  coconut oil
- 0.25|  cup  unsweetened coconut flakes  lightly toasted

directions:
- In a blender, combine the coconut milk, pineapple and vanilla and process until smooth. Pour into 6 popsicle molds and freeze until set, 8 hours.
- In a small, microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate and coconut oil. Microwave on high in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval, until the chocolate has melted, about 2 minutes total. Place the coconut flakes in a bowl.
- Line a plate with parchment paper and set aside. Unmold one popsicle, spoon the chocolate mixture over the top 0.25 of the pop and immediately sprinkle the chocolate with 1 tablespoon of the coconut. Place the popsicle on the prepared plate and freeze. Repeat with the remaining popsicles, chocolate and coconut. Serve immediately or wrap in plastic and store in the freezer for up to 1 month.

The tropical flavors of juicy, ripe pineapple and rich coconut milk combine to make these easy, low-cal popsicles. Theyâ€™re dipped in a super-simple, 2-ingredient dark chocolate shell topping and sprinkled with toasted coconut for a decadent touch.
