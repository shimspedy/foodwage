ingredients:
- mac and cheese:

- 8| ounces  chickpea elbow pasta  used Banza
- 1| tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  medium red bell pepper  seeded and chopped
- 0.5| cup  onion  chopped
- 0.25| cup  fresh corn kernels or defrosted frozen corn
- 1|  medium zucchini  chopped
- 1| tablespoon  chili powder
- 1| teaspoon  ground cumin
- 1.5| tablespoons  whole-wheat pastry flour
- 2| cups  2% milk
- 1|  cup  grated pepper jack cheese  divided
- 0.5| teaspoon  salt
- 1|  medium tomato  sliced

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C) and spray an 8-inch (20.3cm) square baking dish with cooking spray. Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and pour into the prepared baking dish. Reserve the pan used to cook the pasta.
- In a medium sauté pan, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the bell pepper and onion and sauté until tender, 3 minutes. Add the corn and zucchini and cook, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini is crisp-tender, 2 minutes. Stir in the chili powder and cumin, removed from heat and set aside.
- Place the flour in the pot used to boil the pasta. Slowly whisk in the milk and bring to a simmer over low heat, whisking frequently, until bubbly, 4 minutes. (Be careful the sauce doesn’t begin to scorch on the bottom of the pot.) Remove from the heat and whisk in the salt and half the cheese. Pour the sauce over the vegetables and pasta in the baking dish and stir to combine.
- Top with the slices of tomato and the remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, until the cheese is bubbly, 15 minutes.

This zesty mac and cheese uses chickpea pasta to boost the protein to 28 grams per serving and also packs loads of veggies, which ups the fiber content to 11 grams. Look for the new bean-based pastas in grocery stores and online.
