- 1.75|  cup  whole wheat pastry flour
- 1|  teaspoon  cinnamon
- 1|  teaspoon  baking powder
- 1|  teaspoon  baking soda
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.75|  cup  coconut sugar  or sugar of choice

- 0.33333333333|  cup  vegetable oil
- 0.25|  cup  low-fat milk
- 0.25|  cup  nonfat Greek yogurt
- 3|  tablespoon  orange juice
- 1|  large  egg
- Zest from 1 medium orange
- 1.25|  cup  fresh cranberries
- 0.5|  cup  white chocolate chips
- 1|  teaspoon  dried orange peel  optional
- Turbinado sugar for topping  optional

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray a 12-muffin pan with cooking spray.
- In a medium bowl, mix the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together.
- In a large bowl, mix the sugar, applesauce, oil, milk, yogurt, orange juice, and egg together until well combined. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients. I like to mix it in 3 batches.
- Fold in the orange zest, orange peel, cranberries, and chocolate chips.
- Pour the batter into the greased muffin pan. Sprinkle some turbinado sugar on top of each muffin if desired.
- Bake for 20 to 23 minutes or until a toothpick comes out of a muffin cleanly. It is okay if there are a few crumbs.
- Store any leftovers in an airtight container in room temperature for a few days. You can also store it in the refrigerator for up to a week

Popping with the sweet aromas of orange and cranberries, these portable babies are a must-make! Extremely soft and moist, Healthy Nibbles & Bits‘ muffin pairs well with a cup of tea (or coffee, if java is calling you name). If you don’t have fresh cranberries, simply swap for dried cranberries (1 cup fresh = 3/4 cup dried).
