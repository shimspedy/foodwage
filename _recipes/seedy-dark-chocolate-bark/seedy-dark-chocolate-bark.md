notes:


ingredients:
- Seedy Dark Chocolate Bark:

- 0.25|  cup  raw shelled pepitas  pumpkin seeds
- 3|  tablespoon  raw shelled sunflower seeds
- 3|  tablespoon  black sesame seeds
- 3|  tablespoon  raw hemp seeds
- 0.25|  tablespoon  flaky sea salt
- bittersweet chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content  chopped

directions:
- Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
- Heat a dry skillet over medium-heat and add the pumpkin seeds. Toast, gently shaking the skillet constantly, until the seeds start to pop and become slightly fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer the pepitas to a small bowl. Repeat the toasting process with the sunflower seeds, sesame seeds and hemp seeds. It’s important to toast all of the seeds separately because the varied sizes toast in different amounts of time. The delicate sesame and hemp seeds will require your full attention and not much time, just about 45 seconds, so cook gently. Add all the toasted seeds to the same bowl, then mix to incorporate. Add the salt, and set aside.
- Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval, until the chocolate is just melted. Stirring distributes the heat in the bowl, which will help the chocolate melt. The chocolate will be slightly warmer than body temperature and runny when it’s ready to use.
- Pour the chocolate into the prepared pan, shaking and tapping the pan to spread it evenly. Sprinkle the seed mixture over the chocolate, then allow to stand at room temperature for up to two hours to set.
- Before serving, break the chocolate into 8 pieces and store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
