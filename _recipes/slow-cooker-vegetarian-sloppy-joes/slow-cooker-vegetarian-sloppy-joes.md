ingredients:
- Slow Cooker Vegetarian Sloppy Joes:

- 1.25|  cup  uncooked green lentils  rinsed and drained
- 1|  white onion  finely diced
- 1|  carrot  thinly sliced, optional
- 3|  cloves garlic  minced
- 1.5|  tablespoon  chili powder
- 1|  teaspoon  cumin
- 1.5|  teaspoon  onion powder
- 0.25|  teaspoon  cayenne pepper
- 1|  can tomato sauce
- 1|  can diced tomatoes
- 1.5|  cups  water  plus more if necessary
- 2|  tablespoon  organic ketchup
- 1|  teaspoon  yellow mustard
- 1|  teaspoon  gluten-free soy sauce
- spaghetti squash  washed
- Salt and pepper  to taste

directions:
- In a large slow cooker, combine all ingredients except spaghetti squash. Stir.
- Cut the washed spaghetti squash in half around the middle and scoop out the seeds. Place the squash halves cut-side down in the slow cooker right on top of the lentils. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or until squash is tender and lentils are cooked completely. If the lentils seem dry, stir in additional water until it reaches a nice, thick consistency.
- Remove spaghetti squash and shred inside with a fork. Divide among bowls and add lentil sloppy joe topping. Sprinkle with cheese, if desired.

For the walnut topping

Combine all of the ingredients for the walnut topping in a small bowl. Stir well to combine and set aside.

For the cake

Preheat the oven to 350°F and lightly butter or oil a 8-by-8 baking dish.

In a mixing bowl, stir together the coconut flour, arrowroot flour, baking powder and salt.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, maple syrup, coconut milk and butter. Pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture and mix until smooth. Note: The batter will be thick.

Pour half the cake batter into the prepared baking dish and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Spread half of the walnut topping over the batter. Repeat with the remaining cake batter and walnut topping.

Bake on the center rack for 28–35 minutes or until cake tests clean when poked in the center.

Allow cake to sit 20 minutes before slicing and serving.
