The oat soak is like pre-cooked oatmeal, but better because you can eat it warm or cold. Instead of cooking the oats in water, they absorb the protein-rich milk and yogurt as they soak, giving them great flavor and creaminess. The addition of chopped strawberries gives the soak a pink tint, and a garnish of kiwi and mint is pretty and tasty.
