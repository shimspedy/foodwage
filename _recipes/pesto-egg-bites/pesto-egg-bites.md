Make a batch of these mini frittatas on Sunday night for an entire week’s worth of healthy breakfasts. Pair a few with oatmeal or yogurt and fruit for a complete breakfast, or grab a couple for a protein-packed afternoon snack.
A little feta or goat cheese adds a finishing touch, but if you’re dairy-free, skip the cheese and use a dairy-free pesto.
