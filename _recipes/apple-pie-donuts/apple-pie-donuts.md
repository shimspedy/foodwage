ingredients:
- Apple Pie Donuts:

- 0.75|  cup  gluten-free flour
- 1|  teaspoon  baking powder
- 0.75|  teaspoon  apple pie spice  divided
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  cup  brown sugar
- 0.25|  cup  milk
- 0.5|  cup  finely chopped apple
- 0.5|  cup  vanilla yogurt
- egg  beaten
- tablespoon  coconut oil  melted
- 1|  cup  powdered sugar
- 2|  drops of almond extract
- 3|  tablespoon  crushed pecans  optional

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Coat a donut pan with cooking spray and set aside.
- In a mixing bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt and 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice. Add the apples, milk, yogurt, egg and oil. Mix until a thick batter forms.
- Using a small spoon carefully fill each donut shape 3/4 of the way full. Be careful not to overfill. Bake 10–12 minutes.
- Carefully remove the donuts and let cool completely on a wire rack.
- To make the glaze, combine the powdered sugar, milk, almond extract and 1/4 teaspoon apple pie spice. If your mixture is too thick, add additional milk one teaspoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency.
- Drizzle the glaze onto the donuts and sprinkle crushed pecans on top, if using.
