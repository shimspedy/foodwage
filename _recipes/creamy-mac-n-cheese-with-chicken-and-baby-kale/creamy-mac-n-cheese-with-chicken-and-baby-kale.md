ingredients:
- Creamy Mac n Cheese With Chicken and Baby Kale:

- 2|  tsp  olive oil
- boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-size strips
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 0.5|  tsp  pepper
- 1|  small onion  finely chopped
- 2|  cup  low-sodium chicken broth
- 1|  cup  2% milk
- 1|  package  frozen butternut squash
- 2|  tsp  dry mustard
- 1|  bay leaf
- 2.25|  cup  whole-wheat elbow macaroni
- 3|  cup  baby kale
- 1.25|  cup  sharp cheddar cheese
- 2|  tbsp  nutritional yeast

directions:
- Heat the oil in a large saucepan or skillet set over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add the chicken. Season with the salt and pepper and cook without stirring for 2 minutes. Add the onions, stir and continue to cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover.
- Add the broth, milk, squash, mustard and bay leaf to the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Mash the squash with a potato masher until mostly smooth. Add the pasta and stir to combine. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook for 6 minutes, stirring once. Fold in the chicken-onion mixture and kale with a rubber spatula, cover and cook until the kale has wilted, 2 minutes.
- Remove the pan from the heat and stir the cheese and nutritional yeast into the pasta. Serve immediately

Frozen butternut squash cubes add body and nutrients to this simple one-pot macaroni and cheese. We’ve added chicken breast and baby kale to make this a complete meal. Substitute spinach or chopped chard if you like. By using whole-wheat macaroni, you can boost the fiber by 3–4 grams per serving.
