Enjoy this easy, breezy mango-pineapple yogurt bowl for a tropical breakfast treat. Plain yogurt is sweetened naturally with chunks of pineapple and mango, along with toasted coconut flakes. Plain yogurt is an excellent breakfast choice because itâ€™s a probiotic (e.g. source of good bacteria), and contains a good dose of protein, calcium and vitamin D.
