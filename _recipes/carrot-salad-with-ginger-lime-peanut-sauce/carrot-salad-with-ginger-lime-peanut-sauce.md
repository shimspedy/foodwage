Take a break from the romaine and give this delicious raw carrot salad from The Roasted Root a try. The tangy, ginger lime peanut dressing over thin strips of carrots makes this salad the perfect side with a grilled chicken breast or piece of fresh fish. If you donâ€™t have a mandoline to cut the carrots, no problem! A simple spiralizer or a julienne peeler will do the trick.
