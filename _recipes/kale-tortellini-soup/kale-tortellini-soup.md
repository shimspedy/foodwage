chef: foodwage
time: under 40 mins
servings: 8

notes:
- Dry, fresh, or frozen pasta of any shape will work here- just follow the cooking time noted on the package. Use gluten-free noodles to make this soup gluten-free. Cooking pasta separately allows you to store leftovers in the fridge without having the pasta soak up all the soup broth.

ingredients:
- Soup:

- 1| sweet onion
- 1| tablespoon olive oil
- 3| cloves  garlic
- 0.5| cup  chopped carrots
- 1| teaspoon oregano
- 1| teaspoon basil
- 1| teaspoon rosemary
- 4| cups  vegetable broth  low sodium, (32 ounces)
- 3| cups water or additional broth  (24 ounces)
- 1| can diced tomatoes  (14 ounce)
- 0.5| pound package cheese tortellini
- 4| ounces sliced baby bella mushrooms
- 0.5| bunch curly kale  (about 8 ounces; 224 grams)

- Optional Garnishes:

- Chopped fresh parsley
- Grated Parmesan cheese

directions:
- Begin by chopping your onion and carrots and finely mincing your garlic
- In a very large soup pot, sautee the onion with a tablespoon of oil over medium heat until soft and then add in the garlic. Cook for another minute, and then add the carrots and your favorite Italian dried herbs (I used a blend of oregano, basil, and rosemary noted above).
- Cook for another 3-5 minutes and then add the vegetable broth, water, and diced tomatoes (do not drain the can).
- Let the soup simmer on medium-low heat for 20 minutes on the stove, and cook your tortellini in the meantime. I like to cook them separately so that the pasta doesnâ€™t break down in the broth if there are leftovers.
- Add the sliced mushrooms to the soup along with the kale(after giving it a rough chop into pieces).
- Let the soup simmer for another 5-10 minutes and serve, topping with parsley and/or parmesan.
