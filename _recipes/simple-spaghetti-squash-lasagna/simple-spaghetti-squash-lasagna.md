ingredients:
- Simple Spaghetti Squash Lasagna:

- 1|  spaghetti squash  halved lengthwise and seeded
- JENNIE-O® Ground Turkey
- 0.5|  teaspoon  garlic powder
- 0.25|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 2.5|  cup  Puttanesca (or Marinara) sauce  divided
- 1.5|  cup  part skim ricotta cheese
- 1.5|  cups  shredded mozzarella cheese
- 3|  heaping tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese
- 0.25|  teaspoon  dried oregano
- 0.5|  teaspoon  garlic powder
- 0.5|  teaspoon  dried parsley
- 0.25|  teaspoon  sea salt

directions:
- Heat oven to 400°F. Place spaghetti squash halves cut side down onto a baking sheet. Bake 60 minutes or until a knife easily passes through the squash. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
- In a large skillet, over medium-high, add ground turkey. Cook ground turkey for 8 to 10 minutes until no longer pink. Always cook to well done, 165°F as measured by a meat thermometer. Add 2 cups of tomato sauce to turkey, mix well, and set aside.
- In a medium bowl, mix together the cheeses, herbs, and salt until well combined. Scrape cooled spaghetti squash with a fork, and layer the bottom of a 9-by-13 inch baking dish. Top with ground turkey, then sprinkle with cheese using the back of a spoon to spread the cheese evenly over the turkey. Add remaining 1/2 cup tomato sauce over the cheese layer and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese. Cover and bake for 30 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.

Enjoy a lighter but equally satisfying Italian lasagna with just two simple swaps. Spaghetti squash instead of pasta sneaks in more veggies for the day. Lean ground turkey in place of ground beef helps you cut your daily intake of saturated fat.
