ingredients:
- Sweet Spicy Chicken Cobb Salad:

- 2|  small boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 3|  tablespoon  safflower oil  divided
- 3|  teaspoon  salt-free chili powder  divided
- 1|  pinch salt
- 3|  tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
- 3|  tablespoon  ketchup
- 4|  teaspoon  honey
- 9|  cups  romaine lettuce  chopped and lightly packed
- 1|  slice thick-cut bacon  cooked, drained and crumbled
- 1|  medium avocado  diced (1 cup)
- 1|  cup  canned, low-sodium black beans  drained and rinsed
- 1|  cup  frozen corn  defrosted
- 1|  cup  chopped tomatoes

directions:
- Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium heat. Drizzle the chicken with 1 teaspoon of oil and sprinkle all over with 2 teaspoons of chili powder and the salt. Grill, flipping occasionally until the chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F (74°C), about 15 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Chop into bite-size pieces.
- In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 teaspoon of chili powder, vinegar, ketchup, and honey until smooth. Gradually whisk in the remaining oil.
- Divide the lettuce among 4 plates. Arrange the chicken in a line over the lettuce. Arrange the bacon, avocado, beans, corn, and tomatoes in parallel lines over the lettuce. Drizzle with the dressing.

It’s easy to eat the rainbow with this colorful, hearty, composed salad. The dressing, a zesty riff on homemade French dressing, gets a little spice from salt-free chili powder and honey. Feel free to use a hot chili blend if you’d like to turn up the heat.
