Here’s a twist on porkchops and apple sauce: Cooking Light’s spiced pork tenderloin served with a side of sautéed apples. The lean pork tenderloin medallions are rubbed in a sweet spice coating and cooked over a cast iron skillet. The apples get a savory treatment sautéed in shallots and thyme. This high protein, low carb recipe is quick to make and, once you taste it, quick to vanish!
