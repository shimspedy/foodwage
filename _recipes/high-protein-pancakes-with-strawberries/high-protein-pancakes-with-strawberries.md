ingredients:
- High-Protein Pancakes With Strawberries:

- 1|  cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
- 0.5|  cup  whey protein powder
- 1.5|  baking powder
- 1|  tbsp  light brown sugar
- 1|  cup  skim milk
- 2|  large  egg whites
- 1|  large egg
- 1|  tbsp  canola oil
- 1|  cup  strawberries  sliced
- 0.25|  cup  pure maple syrup
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 200ºF (93ºC) to keep the finished cakes warm, and get a large, oven-safe plate ready to put them on. In a large bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour, whey powder, baking powder and brown sugar; whisk to combine.
- In a medium bowl, combine the milk, egg whites, egg and canola oil and stir. Preheat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat.
- Use a tablespoon measure to scoop slightly rounded portions onto the hot pan, leaving an inch of space between the pancakes. Cook for about 2 minutes on the first side. When the cakes are covered with bubbles and the edges look done, flip and cook for about a minute more. Transfer to the plate. Keep each batch of cakes in the oven until the next is done.

If you want a little more protein with your pancakes, try these. Fortified with whey protein powder and eggs, they are just as tender and fluffy as your favorite pancakes. The whey protein adds about 6g of protein per serving and a modest drizzle of maple syrup or a sprinkling of sliced berries makes your breakfast just sweet enough to feel like a splurge.
