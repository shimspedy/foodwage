Most people don’t get enough dietary fiber in their daily fare. Try adding this fiber-rich breakfast to your repertoire, and savor the maple and raspberry flavors while you tuck into a healthy breakfast.
RD tip: Flaxseeds have different health benefits depending on whether they are served whole (where you get the fiber benefits), or ground, (which releases the heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids). This recipe has both whole and ground flaxseeds, giving you the most bang for your nutrition buck.
