If you’re a fan of the classic BLT sandwich, check out this BLT salad with avocado from Skinnytaste. Creamy, mayonnaise-marinated tomatoes, romaine lettuce and diced avocados are topped with pieces of lean bacon. If you’re missing the bun, you can add it back in the form of crunchy croutons or serve a slice of your favorite, crusty bread on the side.
