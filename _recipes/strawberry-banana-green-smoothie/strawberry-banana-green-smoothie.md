This smoothie from Fit Foodie Finds features strawberries and spinach, which are at their seasonal best in the spring. Unsweetened almond milk serves as a low-sugar alternative to juices. Plus, the recipe is designed to be meal-prepped and separated into four freezer bags to grab, blend and go in the morning.
