ingredients:
- Asparagus and Pea Pesto Salad Pizza:

- 1|  Joseph’s Flax Whole-Wheat Pita  medium
- 0.25|  cup  frozen peas  thawed
- 2|  tbsp  fresh basil
- 0.25|  large garlic clove  sliced
- 2|  tbsp  olive oil  divided
- 4|  spears asparagus
- 1|  oz  fresh mozzarella  drained and thinly sliced
- 1|  cup  mixed greens
- 2|  large grape tomatoes
- 1|  tsp  balsamic vinegar
- Freshly ground black pepper  to taste

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Place the pita atop a sheet pan. In a food processor or mini-chopper, place the peas, garlic and basil and process, scraping down until finely minced.
- Drizzle in 1 teaspoon of the olive oil and repeat; it will be a little chunky. Spread the pea pesto on the pita bread.
- Chop the asparagus in 0.75-inch pieces, discarding the tough bases. Scatter the asparagus over the pea pesto and place the sliced mozzarella on top. Bake for 10 minutes, until the edges are crisp.
- While the pita bakes, place mixed greens in a medium bowl and add the grape tomatoes, remaining olive oil, balsamic vinegar and a few grinds of pepper. Toss to coat.
- When the pita is baked, cut in quarters, place on a plate and cover with salad. Serve immediately.

A healthy riff on pizza is the salad pizza, which is essentially two dishes in one. The crisp crust is warm and has just enough hot, melty toppings to wilt the salad a little. The contrast of warm and cold, with creamy pesto and crunchy greens adds taste and texture for a low-calorie, veggie-rich meal.
