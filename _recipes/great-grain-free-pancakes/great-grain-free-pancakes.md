ingredients:
- Great Grain-Free Pancakes:

- 2.5  cup  almond flour or homemade pecan flour  see instructions below
- 0.75|  cup  applesauce
- 4|  large  eggs
- 0.75|  tsp  baking powder
- 0.5|  tsp  ground cinnamon
- 0.5|  tsp  sea salt
- tsp  0.5|  vanilla extract
- 0.5|  tsp  vanilla extract
- Coconut oil

directions:
- To make homemade nut flour: use blanched almonds or raw pecans. Place the 2 cups nuts in a food processor and pulse until a fine-grain flour forms. Be very careful not to turn the nuts into nut butter and check the consistency often! When it’s coarse and builds on the side of the food processor bowl like wet sand might when building a sand castle, the flour is ready.
- Whisk together the nut flour, applesauce, eggs, baking powder, sea salt, cinnamon and vanilla extract in a large bowl until well combined. The batter will be nice and thick. Be sure to break up any clumps!
- Set a large skillet over medium heat and melt just enough coconut oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Pour a small amount of batter into the center of the pan, spreading with the back of a spatula, if necessary, and allow the pancake to cook until small bubbles form on the surface (roughly 3 minutes). Flip, and allow the second side to brown (another 3 minutes or so). Repeat with the remaining batter.

A fluffy, high stack of flapjacks can still be yours, even if grains aren’t on your menu. This quick-and-easy recipe uses almond flour to set up satisfying cakes that are perfect with berries, eggs and certainly a drizzle of coconut syrup. Making your own pecan flour is also an option if you’re so inclined.
