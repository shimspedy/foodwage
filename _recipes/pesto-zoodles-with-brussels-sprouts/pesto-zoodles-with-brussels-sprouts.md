Keep healthy and curl up with this warm pesto turnip “pasta” from Inspiralized. Brussels sprouts add a hearty amount of vitamin C, which is an important antioxidant that aids in iron absorption and collagen production. If you don’t have turnips on hand, simply sub in zucchini, rutabaga, butternut squash or beets.
