ingredients:
- Chocolatey Brownie-Yogurt Parfaits:

- 0.5|  cup  unsweetened applesauce
- 0.75|  cup  all-purpose flour
- 0.5|  cup  cocoa
- 0.25|  tsp  salt
- 0.25|  tsp  baking soda
- large egg white
- 1|  large egg
- 4|  cup  plain 0% Greek yogurt
- 0.5|  tsp  vanilla
- 4|  cup  0% vanilla yogurt
- 1|  cup  fresh raspberries
- 8|  sprigs fresh spearmint

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC). Lightly coat an 8-inch square metal baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Stack four paper towels on the counter and fold the stack in half. Spread the applesauce on the paper towels and let drain for 15 minutes.
- In a large bowl, combine the flour, cocoa, salt and baking soda, and whisk to mix. In a medium bowl, place the egg white, egg, plain yogurt and vanilla and whisk lightly. With a spatula, scrape the drained applesauce off of the paper towels, add to the egg mixture and whisk to mix.
- Stir the applesauce mixture into the flour mixture, just to combine. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake for about 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the pan comes out with moist crumbs attached. Cool on a rack.
- Slice the brownies into 2-inch squares to make 16 squares.
- To assemble the parfaits: In glass bowls, ramekins or wine glasses that hold one cup, assemble the parfaits by layering 0.25 cup vanilla yogurt plus one broken brownie; repeat each layer and top with 1 tablespoon raspberries. Garnish with a mint sprig. Store uneaten portions tightly covered for up to a day.

When you get a chocolate craving, answer it with this delicious dessert. You can try out a neat trick: Draining the moisture from applesauce to make a thicker paste to stand in for butter. The chocolatey brownies and tangy vanilla yogurt make a delicious combination. This makes eight parfaits, but if you don’t need that many, you can just freeze the extra brownies to eat later.
