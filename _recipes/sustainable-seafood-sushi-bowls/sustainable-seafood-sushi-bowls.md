ingredients:
- Sustainable Seafood Sushi Bowls:

- 1|  cup  short-grain brown rice
- 1|  pinch  salt
- 3|  tablespoon  dried wakame seaweed
- 3|  tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
- 1|  tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce
- 1|  tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
- 1|  teaspoon  wasabi powder
- 0.5|  teaspoon  fresh ginger  finely grated
- 12|  ounces  wild sashimi-grade salmon  skin removed, thinly sliced
- peeled and deveined wild shrimp  cooked
- 1|  green onion  thinly sliced
- 1|  medium  avocado  pitted and sliced
- 0.25|  cup  salmon roe  optional
- 1|  tablespoon  sesame seeds  toasted

directions:
- Combine the rice with 1.5 cups water and 1 pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to maintain a bare simmer and cook until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender, 30 minutes. Remove from the heat, fluff with a fork, cover and set aside for 10 minutes.
- While the rice cooks, soak the seaweed in 1 cup (237mL) cold water for 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, wasabi and ginger.
- Divide the rice between 4 bowls. Arrange the seaweed, salmon, shrimp, avocado and salmon roe atop the rice. Drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Serve immediately.
