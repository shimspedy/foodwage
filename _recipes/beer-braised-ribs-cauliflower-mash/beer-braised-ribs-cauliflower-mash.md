ingredients:
- Ribs:

- 3|  lb  beef short ribs  cut into 2in pices
- 1|  red onion  chopped
- 2|  celery stalks  sliced
- 3|  garlic cloves  chopped
- 16|  oz  baby carrots
- 2|  tbs  low-sodium tomato paste
- 12|  oz  light beer
- 2|  tbsp  Worcestershire sauce
- 2|  tbsp  salt
- 0.5|  tsp  coarsely ground black pepper
- 1|  cup  frozen petite peas

- cauliflower mashed potatoes:

- 1|  cauliflower head  cut into florets
- 3|  garlic cloves  sliced
- 0.25|  tsp  coarsely ground black pepper

directions:
- Sear short ribs on all sides in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat; this helps to render off more fat, in addition to trimming.
- Place ribs in an even layer in a (5-quart) slow cooker. Add onion, celery, garlic and carrots.
- Stir together tomato paste, beer, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper.
- Pour over ribs and vegetables. Cover, and cook on low heat for 6–8 hours or until ribs are tender.
- While the ribs are slow cooking, prepare the cauliflower mash. Heat about 2 inches of water in the bottom of soup pot fitted with a steamer basket. Allow water to boil then add cauliflower and garlic; steam 10 to 15 minutes or until cauliflower is tender. Drain, and place cauliflower and garlic in a food processor; puree until almost smooth. Stir in salt and pepper.
- Once the ribs are tender, skim off excess fat and stir in peas; cover, and let stand 5 to 10 minutes until peas are thoroughly heated but remain bright green.
- Once the ribs are tender, skim off excess fat and stir in peas; cover, and let stand 5 to 10 minutes until peas are thoroughly heated but remain bright green.
- Transfer ribs and vegetables to a serving platter or serving plates with a slotted spoon. Spoon any fat off the top of liquid, and discard. Drizzle sauce over ribs, vegetables and cauliflower.

Fall-off-the-bone tender short ribs require low heat and long cooking time, just perfect for slow cookers. Serve ribs au jus over cauliflower “mashed potatoes.” These ribs are cooked in a beer-infused liquid, but you can substitute the beer with 11/2 cups low-sodium beef broth, if desired. Remember to trim off excess fat, searing all sides and skimming the top after cooking to keep this dish light.
