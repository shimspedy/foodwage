ingredients:
- Easy Fried Rice–With Bacon!:

- 6|  cup  cooked brown rice  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 6|  strips  bacon, chopped
- 4|  cup  frozen mixed vegetable medley, thawed
- 3|  garlic cloves, minced
- 1.5|  teaspoon  ground ginger
- 1|  tablespoon  educed-sodium soy sauce  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 4|  large  eggs, beaten  50 grams each
- Hot sauce, to taste

directions:
- Prepare brown rice according to package instructions. Approximately 2 cups uncooked brown rice will yield 6 cups of cooked rice. Set cooked rice aside.
- TIME SAVING TIP: Purchase pre-cooked frozen brown rice, and thaw in the microwave for 2-3 minutes.
- Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chopped bacon and cook for 5-7 minutes until bacon is crispy. Remove the bacon bits from pan and set aside.
- To the same skillet, add frozen vegetables, garlic and ginger powder, and stir-fry in the bacon grease. Allow vegetables to cook for 3-5 minutes until tender. Then, add the rice and soy sauce, and stir-fry for another 3-5 minutes.
- Push the rice to the sides of the skillet to make a large well. Pour the eggs into the well and scramble. When the scrambled eggs are fully cooked, turn the heat up to high and stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes allowing the fried rice to sizzle.
- Fold in the bacon bits, and add hot sauce to the your desired level of spiciness.
