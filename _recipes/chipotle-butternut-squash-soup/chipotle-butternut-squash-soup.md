ingredients:
- Chipotle Butternut Squash Soup:

- 1|  dried chipotle chilies
- 1|  butternut squash  halved lengthwise and seeded
- 3|  tablespoon  organic unsalted butter
- 1|  tablespoon  pure maple syrup
- 2|  small carrots  halved crosswise
- 1|  small yellow onion  thinly sliced
- 6|  cup  low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth  divided
- 1.5|  teaspoons sea salt  plus more to taste
- toasted, unsalted pumpkin seeds, cilantro, Greek yogurt  Optional garnishes

directions:
- In a small bowl, soak chilies in warm water for 2–6 hours; drain.
- Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (176°C). In a roasting pan, place squash halves cut side up. Divide butter and maple syrup evenly between the squash cavities. Arrange the carrots and onion around the squash and pour 1 cup broth into the pan. Cover tightly with foil. Bake for 2 hours. Set aside until cool enough to handle.
- Scoop squash flesh from the skins and transfer to a stockpot. Add carrots, onions, cooking liquid from pan, drained chilies, remaining 5 cups broth and salt. Stir well and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, cooking uncovered for 10 minutes.
- With an immersion blender, purée soup until smooth. Add up to 1 cup additional broth if you prefer a thinner soup. Add additional salt as needed. Serve with optional garnishes (if using).

This creamy soup gets its smoky heat from chipotle chilies, but if you need to cool it down, light Greek yogurt does the trick. The sweet butternut squash in this easy, 8-ingredient soup from Clean Eating is quite tasty year-round.
