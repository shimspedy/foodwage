servings: 6

ingredients:
- 2|  medium  Russet potatoes  to provide 3 cups shredded, cooked potato
- 3|  Sweet Chicken Italian Sausages
- 2|  slices of bacon
- 0.5|  medium yellow onion  finely chopped
- 3|  cup  potato, cooked
- 6|  eggs  beaten
- 0.5|  cup  shredded cheddar cheese, divided
- 0.33333333333|  cup  green onion  sliced + extra for garnish
- 1|  teaspoon  canola oil or canola oil spray
- 0.25|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  black pepper

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425°F and bake potatoes for 25-30 minutes, until halfway baked. Note =>  Potatoes must not be fully cooked before shredding, otherwise they will fall apart when shredded. When poked with a knife, potatoes should still be somewhat firm in the middle. Let cool. Grate until you have 3 cups of shredded potato and set aside. This step can be done a day ahead of time. Just store potatoes, covered, in the refrigerator.
- Next, cook the bacon until crispy. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and dice once cool. Drain off the bacon fat and sauté the yellow onion in the same hot pan for 3-5 minutes. Combine onion, ground pepper and salt to the potatoes. Toss until combined.
- Decrease oven temperature to 400F.
- Lightly rub or spray a 12-cup muffin tin with canola oil and press a generous ¼ cup of the potato mixture into each cup, distributing potatoes around the bottom and up the sides. The potatoes will shrink, thus a little overflow is okay. Apply a very light brushing of oil or spray of oil over the potatoes and bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown on the edges.
- Meanwhile, cook sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat until browned. Add green onions, cook for an additional 1-2 minutes and remove from heat.
- Lightly beat eggs, add sausage, green onions and ¼ cup cheddar cheese.
- Allow potato cups to cool for a few minutes and then add 3 tablespoons of egg mixture to each until hash brown nests are nearly full. Sprinkle tops with remaining cheddar cheese, about 1 teaspoon per nest, and place back into oven for 15-20 minutes, until set.
- Garnish with bacon and finely chopped green onions if you have extra. Once slightly cooled, remove egg cups from tins using a fork and a spoon.
- Lori’s recipe was voted the grand prize winner of our Holiday Recipe Remix Contest and will be getting a MyFitnessPal apron, a Withings Smart Body Analyzer scale, a cookbook from Cooking Light, a Fitbug Orb and a one-week personalized meal plan from Elle, the MyFitnessPal RD!

Pre-baked, grated potato forms a nice little nest for the egg, green onion, sausage and cheese. To cut the fat without losing that delicious sausage flavor, Elle swapped out ground pork for ground chicken sausage.

Besides looking great on a serving platter, these Sausage Egg Nests allow all of your holiday brunch guests to get hot eggs, which is probably why those sinful egg casseroles came about in the first place.
