The Honour System’s sweet and tangy sesame chicken salad is as simple as 1, 2, 3: make salad, make sauce and toss together! Cabbage, an antioxidant-rich cruciferous vegetable, provides a refreshing crunch in each bite — paired with a simple sesame dressing and roasted almonds, this salad is a keeper. If you’re strapped for time, use leftover chicken.
