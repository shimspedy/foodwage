notes:
- You can create the pot stickers ahead of time and freeze. Simply thaw, pan fry and enjoy!

ingredients:
- Pot Stickers:
- 1.25| pounds  ground lean pork
- 0.5| cup  chopped baby spinach
- 1.5| tablespoons  fresh thyme
- 1| tablespoon  minced ginger
- 3|  tablespoons  soy sauce
- 1| tablespoon rice wine
- 0.5| tablespoon  sesame oil
- 1| teaspoon  garlic powder
- 35|  pot sticker wrappers  (about 1 pack of wrappers)
directions:
- In a large bowl, mix the pork, spinach, ginger, thyme, soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, and garlic powder together.
- In a small bowl, pour a bit of water, which you will use to prep your pot sticker wrappers. Take a wrapper and dip the edge in water to about 1/2 inch deep. Rotate the wrapper so that you get a half-circle of water. This allows you to fold and seal the potsticker.
- Let the pot sticker wrapper rest on your fingers on your left hand. Then, you’ll fill the center with a spoonful of meat. Resist the urge to fill it with too much filling! It will make the folding more difficult.
- Using your right thumb and forefinger, pinch and seal a bit of the dry part of the wrapper with the wet part. Use your left thumb to hold the filling down as you pleat the potsticker. Then, using your forefingers, pinch a bit of the wet part of the wrapper together. You have created your first pleat! Press down that pleat along the dry side of the wrapper. Continue creating pleats until until you reach the end on the left side. Repeat with remaining pot stickers.
- To cook the pot stickers, heat a large sauté pan with a tablespoon of oil over medium high heat. When the pan is hot, line the potstickers in the pan, bottom side down.
- Let the pot stickers fry for about a minute, then pour about 3 tablespoons of water in the pan and cover it with a lid. Reduce the heat just a little. When the water evaporates, continue adding another 3 tablespoons of water and close the lid. Continue doing this until you have cooked the pot stickers for about 6-8 minutes.
- Dip in soy sauce or chili sauce, if desired.
