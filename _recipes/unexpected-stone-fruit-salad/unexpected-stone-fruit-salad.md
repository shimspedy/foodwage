ingredients:
- Unexpected Stone Fruit Salad:

- tomatoes a mix of small heirlooms and cherry tomatoes, halved
- ripe stone fruits a mix of plums, apricots, pluots, peaches and/or nectarines, sliced
- 0.25|  cup  high-quality olive oil
- 2|  tablespoon  maple syrup
- A few pinches of fine-grain sea salt
- 0.33333333333|  cup  toasted almonds  chopped
- 1|  tablespoon  capers  drained
- 0.33333333333|  cup  fresh chives  choppped
- ciliegine mozzarella  halved
- A handful of fresh basil leaves  torn
- Zest of one lemon
- Drizzle of olive or lemon oil  for finishing
- Flaked sea salt  optional, for finishing

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F (177ºC) and place the oven rack in the top third of the oven. Halve (or slice) all of your tomatoes and stone fruits. Preferably, this will be a colorful mix of heirlooms, cherry tomatoes and other colorful fruits. You want all the pieces to be about the same size so use the cherry tomatoes as a guide for how small to slice them. You’re going to roast half of the fruits and tomatoes.
- Toss half the tomatoes and stone fruits gently (but well) in a bowl with the olive oil, sugar and salt. Arrange in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Allow the fruits to bake, without stirring, for roughly 45–60 minutes or until they’ve shrunken a bit and started to caramelize around the edges. Set aside to cool.
- Meanwhile, halve the mozzarella, zest the lemon, chop the chives and tear the basil.
- When ready to serve, gently toss the roasted and raw fruits with a bit of olive or lemon oil and most of the almonds, chives and basil, as well as all the capers and mozzarella. Taste and season with a bit more salt if needed. Serve topped with the remaining almonds, chives, basil and flaked sea salt if using.
- Recipe makes 8 servings at 3/4 cup each.
