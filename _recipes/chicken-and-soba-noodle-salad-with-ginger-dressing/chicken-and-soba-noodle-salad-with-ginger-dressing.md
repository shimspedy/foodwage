ingredients:
- Chicken and Soba Noodle Salad With Ginger Dressing:

- 2|  tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce
- 2|  tablespoon  rice vinegar
- 1|  tablespoon  honey
- 2|  teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
- 3|  teaspoon  ginger  finely grated
- 3|  medium  garlic clove  finely chopped
- 1|  tablespoon  canola oil
- 3|  cup  shiitake mushrooms  stems discarded, caps sliced
- Salt and peppe  to taste
- 2|  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 4|  cup  broccoli crowns  cut into 2-inch florets
- 0.5|  cup  shelled edamame
- dry buckwheat soba noodles such as Eden Organic
- 3|  green onions  thinly sliced

directions:
- In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, honey, sesame oil, ginger and garlic. Set aside.
- Heat the canola oil in a cast-iron skillet or heavy sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté until tender, 4 minutes. Transfer to a large serving bowl. Season the chicken with the salt and pepper before adding it to the skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Place on a cutting board and let rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
- While the chicken rests, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add the broccoli and edamame and cook until broccoli is crisp-tender, 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to the serving bowl with the mushrooms. Add the soba noodles to the boiling water and cook according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cool water to stop the noodles from overcooking. Add to the noodles to the vegetables in the bowl. Toss with the soy sauce dressing.
- Thinly slice the chicken against the grain and place on top of the noodle mixture. Sprinkle green onions over the top and serve. (The salad can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days.)

Chilled buckwheat soba noodles are traditionally served as cooling meal in the heat of summer in Japan. In this salad, the noodles are tossed with plenty of veggies, grilled chicken and a gingery dressing. Be sure to buy noodles with a high percentage of whole-grain buckwheat flour for the most beneficial fiber.
