notes:

ingredients:
- Soup:

- 1| tsp Olive Oil 1|
- 2| cup Chopped Cauliflower 1|
- 1| cup Low Sodium Chicken Stock or Vegetable Stock 0.5|

- Pesto:

- 2| tbsp Olive Oil 2|
- 2| tbsp pistachio kernels 0.25|
- 1| tbsp 0% Greek yogurt, plain

directions:
- In a medium pot, drizzle 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Place over medium-high heat and add the onions; stir until they start to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the cauliflower and carrots stirring until hot, then add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Cover tightly, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for about 8 minutes. The vegetables will be very tender.
- Transfer the vegetable mixture to a blender or food processor and add the milk. Puree until smooth. Pour back into the pan to keep warm.
- For the pesto, place the parmesan, pistachios and basil in the bowl of a food processor. Process until finely minced, scraping sides and repeating as needed. When smooth, add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and process, scraping as needed to make a smooth paste. Add the yogurt and process to mix.

You don’t need cream for a lush, comforting creamy soup. Cauliflower and carrots puree to a thick, creamy texture — and a little nonfat milk gives it a dairy flavor that hints at cream. A swirl of herby pesto on top gives it Instagram-ready appeal.
