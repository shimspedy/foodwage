ingredients:
- 2|  teaspoon  olive oil

- 1|  medium  onion, chopped
- 2|  teaspoon  ras el hanout spice blend*
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt, divided
- 3|  cup  low-sodium chicken broth, divided

directions:
- Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and onion; cook 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until chicken is golden brown and onion is translucent.
- Stir in ras el hanout blend and 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook 1 minute. Stir in 1 cup chicken broth, squash, and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes or until chicken is done and squash is tender. Stir in cilantro.
- Meanwhile, bring remaining 2 cups chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in couscous and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff with fork.
- Spoon couscous into a serving bowl or individual plates and top evenly with chicken mixture. Drizzle evenly with pan juices.
- Ras el Hanout is a seasoning blend with a very lengthy list of spices used in Moroccan and North African cuisine. For this recipe, you can substitute 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander, 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon, a pinch of ground allspice, and a pinch of cloves.

Spiced just right for fall, this flavorful chicken stew is delicious served over quick-cooking couscous. To save time, look for cubed winter squash in the produce departmentâ€”you can also substitute with sweet potatoes.
