Spaghetti squash is high in fiber, low in carbs and makes a great substitute for traditional pasta. In this fun vegetarian and gluten-free spin on the classic Italian dish, mushrooms replace the meat, bringing a hearty texture and a great source of essential amino acids and B vitamins. You can also play around with the amount of cheese you use if you have a dairy sensitivity.
