- 0.5|  Lemon  Lemon Juice

- Sweet Potatoes:

- 1.5| pounds  Sweet Potatoes  peeled & chopped into 1″ cubes
- 0.25| cup  Greek Yogurt
directions:
- Prepare the garlic soy marinade by mixing all ingredients together. Tenderize chicken with a fork and marinate in the garlic soy marinade for at least 30 min, ideally overnight.
- Place peeled and chopped sweet potatoes into a pot and cover with cold water by about an inch. Bring to a boil and simmer until you can easily insert a knife through the potatoes, about 6 to 10 minutes.
- While the sweet potatoes are boiling, heat a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add cooking oil. Once oil is heated, add chicken. Sear on both sides for 3 minutes.
- Lower heat to medium, add the thyme, white wine and chicken stock, scraping up any brown bits that may have formed on the pan. There will be some steaming, so be careful!
- Cover and cook the chicken for another 4 to 6 minutes, until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees.
- Drain the sweet potatoes in a colander and let them steam for about 5 minutes to allow some moisture to evaporate. Mash sweet potatoes with Greek yogurt, starting with less and adding more as needed. Season to taste with salt.
- Remove cooked chicken from pan. Prepare corn starch mixture by mixing 2 teaspoons corn starch with 2 tablespoons cold water. Add mustard and corn starch mixture to the pan, bring to a simmer and let sauce cook until it’s thickened. Turn off heat, add lemon juice and chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and pour sauce over the chicken.
