meal: lunch dinner
chef: foodwage
time: under 25 mins
servings: 4

notes:
- To broil the salmon, line a baking sheet with foil and lightly grease the foil. Place the salmon fillets skinned side up on the baking sheet and broil under high heat until cooked through, turning once. The time will depend on the thickness of the salmon and your broiler: 8 to 10 minutes is the norm. The fish should be cooked through when flaked with the tip of a knife in the thickest part.

ingredients:
- salmon:

- 3| tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 0.5| tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 3| tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- Sprinkle  freshly ground pepper
- Sprinkle  salt
- 4|  fillets  skinless center-cut salmon  about 6 ounces (180 g) each, rinsed and patted dry with paper towels

- mustard-dill sauce:

- 2| tablespoons  Dijon mustard  or to taste (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 2| teaspoons  whole-grain Dijon mustard  or to taste (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 0.25| cup  fat-free sour cream
- 1| teaspoon  extra virgin olive oil
- 3| tablespoons  finely chopped fresh dill
- 1|  Pinch  sugar
- to taste  freshly ground pepper
- to taste  Salt

directions:
- To marinate the salmon, combine all of the marinade ingredients in a Pyrex baking dish and mix well, then add the salmon and turn to coat evenly with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.
- To make the sauce, combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Cover and refrigerate.
- Center an oven rack and preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
- Place the salmon skinned side down on a foil-lined baking sheet with sides. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness, until cooked through when flaked with the tip of a knife in the thickest part of the flesh. (There is no need to turn the fish, but you can if you want to.)
- Transfer the salmon to individual plates or a serving platter and evenly divide the sauce over the top, or serve it on the side.
