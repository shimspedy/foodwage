servings: 4

ingredients:
- large  large  Russet potatoes  about 9-ounces each, scrubbed
- 2|  large  all-natural turkey bacon  no nitrites or nitrates added
- 0.25|  cup  yellow onion  finely chopped
- 2|  cloves garlic  minced
- 6|  cups  baby spinach  lightly packed
- 0.25|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  fresh ground 
- black pepper
- 4|  large  eggs
- 0.25|  cup  grated reduced-fat cheddar cheese
- 0.5|  cup  educed-fat (2%) plain Greek yogurt  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 2|  tablespoon  chopped scallions or chives

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425˚F. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with foil and mist with cooking spray. Prick potatoes with a fork and transfer to tray. Bake for 50 minutes, turning once, until tender. Set aside to cool for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350˚F.
- Meanwhile, mist a large skillet with cooking spray and heat on medium-low. Add bacon and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, turning occasionally, until crisp. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate. When cool enough to handle, chop into small pieces.
- To skillet on medium-low, add onion and garlic and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, until softened. Add spinach and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until wilted. Remove from heat.
- If needed, cut a thin slice from long side of each potato so they sit flat on sheet. Cut an oval into the top of each potato and scoop out flesh using a spoon or a melon baller, leaving a shell about 1/3-inch thick. Reserve potato flesh for future use.
- Sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper. Divide spinach mixture and bacon evenly among potatoes. Carefully crack one egg into each potato and top with cheese, dividing evenly. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, to desired doneness of egg. In a small bowl, combine yogurt and scallions, and serve with potatoes.
- TIME SAVING TIP - Bake, cool and scoop the potatoes up to two days in advance. Then, cover and refrigerate until ready to cook and serve.
