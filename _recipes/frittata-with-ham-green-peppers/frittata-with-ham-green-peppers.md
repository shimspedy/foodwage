time: under 20 mins
servings: 4

notes:
- Extra servings make wonderful sandwiches at room temperature or hot. Refrigerate the frittata for up to two days. To reheat: Place the frittata on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray, cover, and bake at 350Â°F for about 10 minutes.

ingredients:
- Frittata with Ham & Green Peppers:

- 2|  tbsp  unsalted butter  divided
- 1|  small onion  chopped
- 1|  medium  green bell pepper
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 0.5|  tsp  black pepper
- 8|  slices  ham  chopped (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 8|  large  eggs  at room temperature
- 0.25|  cup  water
- 0.5|  cup  shredded cheddar cheese  optional
directions:
- Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over low heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, 0.25| teaspoon of the salt and 0.25| teaspoon of the pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender-crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the ham and cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a plate.
- Separate the eggs, placing the yolks in a medium-size bowl and the whites in a large bowl. Lightly beat the yolks with the water, the remaining 0.25| teaspoon salt and the remaining 0.25| teaspoon pepper. Beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Fold the yolks into the whites.
- Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over low heat. Pour in the eggs and spread them evenly with a rubber spatula. Scatter the ham mixture and cheese (if using) over the top, cover, and cook until the eggs are set, 25 to 30 minutes. Slide the frittata onto a plate and serve immediately (puffiness will subside in 5 to 7 minutes).
