time: under 20 mins
servings: 2

notes:
- You can make the crepes ahead of time, stack and freeze them. Thaw if frozen, then reheat the foil-wrapped stack on a baking sheet at 350°F until the crepes are warm and pliable, 5 to 8 minutes, or in a skillet on the stovetop. Assemble as directed.

ingredients:
- Brussels Sprouts:

- 2| tablespoons whole almonds
- 1| teaspoon grape seed oil  (or another neutral flavored oil)
- 11| ounces  Brussels sprouts  cut in half, (about 16 sprouts)
- 0.25| cup balsamic vinegar
- 1|  pinch flaky sea salt

directions:
- Heat a pan (preferably cast iron) on medium high heat. Add the almonds and toast them, shaking the pan occasionally, until they start to brown and are fragrant. Remove them from the pan and, when they are cool enough to handle, coarsely chop them.
- Add the grape seed oil to the same pan. Place the Brussels sprouts, facedown, in the pan. Work in batches if you need to so that the Brussels are in a single layer. Cook them for about 5 minutes, or until they are dark brown on the bottom. Add a few tablespoons (no need to be exact) to the pan and cover it with a lid – this will ensure they are cooked through. I like my Brussels with a bit of crunch still but if you like them softer you may want to add another splash of water to the pan. Remove the Brussels from the pan.
- Add the balsamic vinegar to the same pan. It will start to bubble up immediately. Wait about 15 seconds then pour the reduced balsamic over the Brussels. Top with the chopped almonds and a good pinch of flaky sea salt.
