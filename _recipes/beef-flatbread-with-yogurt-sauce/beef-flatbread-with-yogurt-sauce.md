Cooking Light‘s Mediterranean-inspired flatbread uses budget-friendly lean ground beef simmered slowly in a tomato sauce. Serve on a crispy flatbread with refreshing yogurt sauce and you’ll have a main course that’s hard to resist. Experiment with ground lamb or turkey for a different flavor profile. You can make the meat filling ahead of time, then reheat and assemble when you’re ready to serve.
