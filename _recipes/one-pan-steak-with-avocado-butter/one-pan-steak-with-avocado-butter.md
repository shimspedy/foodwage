notes:

ingredients:
- Butter:

- 0.5|  medium avocado  1|
- 1|  lime, zested and juiced, divided  0.375|

- steak:

- 2|  8 ounce (227g) New York strip steaks, fat trimmed  0.75|
- 0.375|  tsp  salt  1|

- Vegetables:

- 1  pound  green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch (5cm) lengths  6
directions:
- Let the steaks stand at room temperature for 30 minutes so they cook more evenly. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the avocado, butter, green onions, 1 0.5| teaspoons of the lime juice, lime zest and a pinch of salt and mash until smooth. Set aside in the refrigerator.
- Heat a large (12-inch/30.5cm) cast-iron pan skillet high heat and turn on kitchen hood fan or open a window. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels. When the pan is very hot (water drops will sizzle and disappear immediately when flicked into the pan), sprinkle 0.5| teaspoon of salt in the the pan. Add the steaks and cook for 1 minute; flip.
- Continue cooking over high heat, flipping steaks with tongs every 30 seconds or so, until the meat is well browned on both sides and an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into the center of a steak registers 125°F (51.7°C) for medium-rare about 4–5 minutes total. (The meat continues to cook while resting.) Transfer steaks to a plate, season with pepper, tent with foil and set aside.
- Wipe out the skillet and place over medium-high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the green beans and radishes and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender and blistered all over, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the remaining lime juice and 0.25| teaspoon salt.
- Thinly slice the steak against the grain. Arrange the green beans and meat on plates and top with dollops of the avocado butter. Serve immediately.

This one-pan meal comes together quickly thanks to a two-step process. In a cast-iron pan, sear the steak first and set it aside to rest so the juices have time to disperse. While the steak is resting, cook the green beans and radishes in the same hot pan. A dollop of avocado butter adds healthy fat and a luxurious flavor, but it’s optional.
