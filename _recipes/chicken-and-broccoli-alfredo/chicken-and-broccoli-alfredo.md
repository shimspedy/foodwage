notes:


ingredients:
- Chicken and Broccoli Alfredo:

- 3|  large turnips  peeled and ends removed
- 1|  avocado oil
- chicken breast, cut into 0.5| inch (1.27cm) cubes
- 6|  cup  broccoli florets
- Salt and pepper,  to taste

- For the alfredo sauce:

- 0.5|  cup  raw cashews  plus 2| tablespoons
- 1|  head garlic
- 2|  tbsp  full-fat coconut milk
- 2.5|  tbsp  lemon juice
- 1|  cup  water  plus 2| tablespoons
- Salt  to taste

directions:
- Spiralize turnips and set aside.
- To make the sauce, place all the ingredients into a high-powered blender and puree until smooth and creamy, about 45 seconds.
- Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add avocado oil and let it heat for about 30 seconds. Add chicken and salt and cook for 3–5 minutes, stirring occasionally until browned; chicken does not have to be cooked all the way through yet. Add broccoli and season with salt and pepper; sauté for another 5 minutes. Add turnip noodles and cook for 2 or 3 more minutes.
- Turn off the heat and top with sauce, mixing until well combined and warmed through

This healthy take on classic chicken alfredo from Eat The Gains uses protein-rich cashews in lieu of the traditional cream for a silky, better-for-you sauce. Lean chicken gives the dish extra protein so you’ll feel full longer. It makes an excellent weeknight dinner when you’re pressed for time since it’s ready in just 20 minutes.
