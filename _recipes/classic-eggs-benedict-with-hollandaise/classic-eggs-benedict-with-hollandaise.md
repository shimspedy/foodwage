ingredients:
- Classic Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise:

- 3|  large  eggs  divided
- 0.33|  cup  buttermilk
- 1|  tsp  arrowroot powder  or cornstarch
- 0.5|  tsp  fresh lemon juice
- 0.5|  tsp  safflower oil or cooking oil of choice
- 0.125|  tsp  ground cayenne pepper
- 1|  tbsp  fresh basil, chopped, plus additional for garnish
- 2|  slices all-natural turkey bacon
- 2|  slices tomato  1/2-inch-thick
- 1|  whole-grain English muffin, halved and toasted
directions:
- To prepare the sauce: In a small saucepan on medium, whisk 1 egg, buttermilk, arrowroot (or cornstarch), lemon juice, oil and cayenne. Reduce heat to low and cook, whisking often, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir in 1 tbsp basil.
- Meanwhile, poach eggs: Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches water and bring to a simmer. Crack 1 egg into a small cup. With a spoon, make a swirling motion in water and slowly add egg, using spoon to tuck egg white close to yolk. Crack remaining egg into small cup and add to water; repeat tucking motion with egg white. Cook each egg for 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove eggs from water.
- Meanwhile, heat a medium nonstick skillet on medium-high. Add bacon and cook, turning once, until crisp, about 4 minutes per side. Remove bacon from skillet and cut each slice in half; add tomato to skillet and sear, turning once, for 1 to 2 minutes per side. Top English muffin halves with bacon, tomato, egg and hollandaise, dividing evenly. Garnish with additional basil.
