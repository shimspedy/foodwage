ingredients:
- Salad:

- 2| cups  Butternut Squash  peeled and chopped in 1/2″ cubes (approx. 1 small Butternut Squash)
- 2|  small Red Beet  approx. 2″ diameter, chopped into ½” cubes
- 1|  medium Bosc Pear  sliced
- 0.5| cup  Pecans
- 0.33|  cup  Golden Raisins
- 6.5| cups  Spring Green Mix  approx. 10 ounces
- 1| teaspoon  White Chia Seeds

- Dressing:

- 1|  teaspoon  orange zest
- 0.33|  cup  fresh orange juice
- 1| tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
- 3| tablespoons  olive oil
- 0.25|  teaspoon  ground cinnamon
- 0.125| teaspoon  salt
directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
- Peel the butternut squash and either slice it into ½” slices or dice it into 0.5” cubes (or both). Lay the butternut squash on a baking sheet and drizzle enough olive oil over the pieces to coat them well. Sprinkle the butternut squash with salt.
- Peel and chop the beets and lay the pieces on a large piece of foil. Fold the foil, completely covering the beets, creating a foil packet. Place this packet on the baking sheet next to the butternut squash.
- Place the baking sheet in the oven and roast the vegetables for 50 minutes, or until the butternut squash is browned and crispy. Remove from the oven and allow the vegetables to cool.
- In a small bowl, whisk together all the ingredients for the dressing.
- In a large serving bowl, add the remaining salad ingredients and the roasted vegetables. Toss in desired amount of Maple-Orange-Cinnamon Dressing and serve!
