This berry dish from Nutrition Stripped can double as a refreshing breakfast or easy dessert that’s low in added sugar and high in fiber and antioxidants (thanks, berries). Even better, it’s a dairy-free and vegan treat that’s reminiscent of ice cream but takes minutes to make. Use any berry combination you like — because the cashew cream plays nicely with just about any fruit.
