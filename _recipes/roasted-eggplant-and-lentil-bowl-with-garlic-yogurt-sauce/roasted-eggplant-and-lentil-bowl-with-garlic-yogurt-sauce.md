notes:

ingredients:
- lentils:

- 1| cup  uncooked brown lentils  washed and picked over
- 2| cups  low sodium, fat free vegetable broth
- 2| tablespoons  minced fresh ginger  (approx. 1″ root)
- 2| cloves  garlic  minced
- 0.5| tablespoon  cumin
- 2| cloves
- 1| teaspoon  ground black pepper
- 2| small dried ancho peppers  optional

- eggplant:

- 1| large eggplant
- 3| tablespoons olive oil
- 1| teaspoon salt

- dressing:

- 3| cloves  garlic  teaspoons
- 2| teaspoons olive oil
- 2| teaspoons tahini
- 1| teaspoon lemon juice

- Optional Garnish/Toppings:

- 15| oz  chickpeas  rinsed
- Cherry tomatoes halved
- Fresh parsley  chopped

directions:
- Heat lentils, broth, and spices (ginger, garlic, cumin, cloves, black peppers, dried Ancho peppers) in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and cover partially. Tilt the lid so some steam can still escape. Simmer for 25-30 minutes or until vegetable broth is absorbed and lentils are tender. Stir in butter until melted.
- While the lentils are simmering, slice eggplant into 0.25” slices. Layer in a colander and salt them. Toss to distribute the salt and set aside for 5-7 minutes. Rinse the eggplant and pat dry. Arrange eggplant slices in a single layer on a large cookie sheet (or two!). Brush both sides of the eggplant slices with olive oil and broil for 1-2 minutes. Check on the slices and turn if they are starting to lightly brown. Brush again with olive oil. Repeat until slices are tender and evenly browned. Remove from oven.
- In a small bowl, mix the yogurt dressing ingredients together with a fork. Stir until evenly mixed.
- To make the bowls – divide lentils into 4 bowls, top with chopped eggplant slices and spoon yogurt dressing on top. Garnish with fresh, chopped parsley, chickpeas, and halved cherry tomatoes if desired.

There’s only so many ways you can spice up a veggie bowl right? Wrong! This recipe from Dietitian Debbie calls for a roasted eggplant and lentil bowl smothered in garlicky yogurt sauce. Yum! To educate yourself on eggplants, here are some cook’s notes from Dietitian Debbie herself: Use eggplants as soon as you buy them because fresher eggplants will be less bitter than older ones. Also, cook them thoroughly. Half-cooked eggplants won’t taste half as great.
