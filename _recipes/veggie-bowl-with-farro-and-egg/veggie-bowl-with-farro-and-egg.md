ingredients:
- Veggie Bowl with Farro and Egg:

- 2|  tablespoon  extra virgin olive oil
- 1|  cup  carrots  shredded
- 1|  cup  shiitake mushrooms  sliced
- 1|  cup  Brussels sprouts
- 1|  cup  purple cabbage
- 1|  cup  farro
- 2|  cup  vegetable broth
- 0.5|  teaspoon  garlic powder
- 0.5|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 2|  Eggland’s Best eggs
- Sriracha sauce or other kind of chili sauce
- Hemp seeds  for garnish

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F. In a large bowl, toss mushrooms and Brussels sprouts with olive oil, garlic powder and sea salt. Spread veggies on a baking sheet and roast for 20–25 minutes.
- While veggies are roasting, make farro. In a medium saucepan, bring farro, a pinch of sea salt and broth to a simmer. Simmer on low until farro is tender and the liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes.
- Just before serving, fry two eggs over easy in small sauté pan.
- To serve, divide the cooked farro, roasted Brussels sprouts and mushrooms, avocado, carrots and purple cabbage between the bowls. Top each bowl with one fried egg. Sprinkle with hemp seeds, and serve with drizzle of Sriracha or chili sauce.
