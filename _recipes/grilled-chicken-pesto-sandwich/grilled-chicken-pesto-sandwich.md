- 2|  boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 1.5|  tbsp  olive oil
- 0.5|  tbsp  dried oregano
- 0.5|  tbsp  dried basil
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 0.5|  tsp  black pepper

- 6|  tablespoon  roasted red peppers
- 6|  tbsp  roasted red peppers
- 1|  medium  tomato  sliced
directions:
- Preheat grill to medium-high heat.
- Butterfly the chicken breasts to create 4 thin chicken breasts. Brush chicken breasts with olive oil and then sprinkle with spices (oregano, basil, salt and pepper).
- Place the chicken breasts on the grill. Grill for 6 minutes, flip and grill for 6-7 more minutes or until chicken is fully cooked.
- Meanwhile, slice the loaf of French bread into 4 sections. Split each section in half. Spread the pesto evenly on the 4 bottom halves of bread. Set aside.
- Once the chicken is fully cooked, remove it from the grill and slice into strips. Place chicken breasts onto the pesto-rubbed pieces of French bread. Top each sandwich with a slice of provolone cheese, several strips of roasted red peppers and a slice of tomato. Place top piece of bread on sandwiches.
- (Optional) While the grill is still hot (but with the burners turned off), place sandwiches on the grill for 2-3 minutes. Serve sandwiches hot.

This yummy grilled chicken and pesto sandwich by Food Fanatic makes a great grab-and-go lunch. Lean grilled chicken is served with creamy pesto between two slices of french bread. If you donâ€™t have a grill or would rather make this on a stovetop you can pan-fry the chicken breasts instead.
