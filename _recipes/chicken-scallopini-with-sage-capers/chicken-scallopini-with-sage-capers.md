time: under 20 mins
servings: 4

notes:
- You can make this dish in bulk then freeze and reheat. To reheat, arrange the scallopini in a baking dish, cover, and bake at 350°F until heated through, about 15 minutes. Drizzle with a little olive oil to replace lost moisture.

ingredients:
- Scallopini:

- 0.25| cup  dry white wine or chicken broth
- 0.33| cup  chicken broth
- 1| tablespoon drained capers
- 4|  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves  (6 ounces each), pounded to 0.25″ thick
- 0.5| teaspoon salt
- 0.25| teaspoon ground black pepper
- 0.75| teaspoon rubbed sage
- 3| tablespoons whole wheat flour
- 4| teaspoons  olive oil
- 1| teaspoon cornstarch
- 2| teaspoons cold water
- 1.5| tablespoons cold butter  cut in small pieces
- 2| teaspoons chopped fresh parsley  (optional)

directions:
- In a small bowl, combine the wine or broth, broth, capers and set aside.
- Season the chicken with the salt, pepper, and sage. Lightly coat with the flour, patting off the excess.
- Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat and add 2 teaspoons of the olive oil. Add 2 pieces of the chicken and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and turn the chicken. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 2 minutes. Remove to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm.
- In a small cup, combine the cornstarch and water.
- Pour the caper mixture into the skillet and heat over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Cook, whisking until thickened, about 15 seconds. Whisk in the butter and spoon the sauce over the chicken. Sprinkle with the parsley (if using).
