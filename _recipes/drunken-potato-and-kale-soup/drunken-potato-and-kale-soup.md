What’s the best way to get drunk? On kale soup! Love & Zest’s recipe for potato and kale soup calls for a bubbly bottle of beer and we have no objections. The alcohol is cooked out of the soup, of course, but leaves behind enough flavor for a fuller broth. Each comforting cup of soup is low in calories, high in fiber and full of important vitamins A and C.
