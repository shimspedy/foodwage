- to taste  salt

directions:
- Preheat an oven to 400Â°F. Lightly spray four oven-safe dishes or ramekins with cooking spray.
- Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, add oil, shallots and cook 2-3 minutes. Add spinach, salt and pepper and cook until the spinach wilts, about 2-3 minutes. Mix in Asagio cheese and remove from heat.
- Divide the wilted spinach among the oven-safe dishes, making a well in the center of each. Break an egg into each dish and season with salt and pepper. Place the ramekins on one or two rimmed baking sheets and bake until the whites are set and the yolks are firm around the edges, but still soft in the center, about 17 minutes or to your liking. Serve immediately.
