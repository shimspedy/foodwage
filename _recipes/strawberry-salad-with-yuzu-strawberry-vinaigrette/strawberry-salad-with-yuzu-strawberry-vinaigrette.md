Yuzu is an Asian citrus fruit with a slightly floral aroma and sweet-tart flavor that pairs perfectly with ripe strawberries. Look for it in small bottles where Asian ingredients are sold, or substitute equal parts lime and orange juice in a pinch. Youâ€™ll get a serving each of fruits and vegetables and the goat cheese and almonds add substance to this salad.
