Cooler temperatures and the general need for quick, nutritious meals leaves us craving comforting, warm breakfasts this time of year. With an emphasis on the word “quick,” it’s time to lean on the Instant Pot.
It’s a trendy — and very convenient — kitchen gadget you’ll want in your back pocket, if it’s not already there. We can’t recommend one highly enough. This little countertop machine steams, sautees, slow-cooks and pressurizes (some models even bake cakes and make yogurt!) food to make delicious meals in no time.
Today, we’re going to use it for one of the most straightforward purposes yet: oatmeal. This little machine makes hearty, whole-grain bowls a breeze at breakfast because it can cook oats in 8 minutes, plus 5 minutes of natural release, while you’re getting ready for work. (Read: No stirring, burning or standing at the stove!)
The steps are simple. Combine liquids and oats, seal the pot, then cook. In the morning you can dole up bowls to your liking. This is a handy strategy whether you’re looking to enjoy the oats straight away or if you’d like to portion the oatmeal into jars and store for an entire week — just reheat and enjoy when you’re ready.
A few notes about cooking in the Instant Pot instead of the stovetop: First, if you choose to use a high-fat milk (cow’s milk or coconut milk) then the fat in the milk may separate. It’s also good to note that you won’t need nearly as much liquid to cook oats in the Instant Pot as on the stove, because there isn’t any evaporation during the cooking process. On the stovetop, some of the liquid evaporates as the grains cook. In the Instant Pot, the liquid is simply absorbed. Avoid oatmeal soup by not adding too much.
