notes:

ingredients:
- Poached Egg and Asparagus Salad:

- 1|  tbsp  olive oil
- 1|  tsp  lemon juice
- 2|  tsp  white balsamic vinegar
- asparagus about 12-14| stalks), trimmed
- 4|  cup  fresh arugula
- 0.25|  cup  thinly sliced red onion
- 3|  small radishes
- 0.25|  cup  loosely packed fresh herbs  I used basil and parsley
- 2|  large  eggs
- Ground black peppe
directions:
- In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice and balsamic vinegar. Set aside.
- Steam asparagus over boiling water until just tender crisp, about 4 minutes if stalks are thin/medium, 7 minutes if thick. Remove from heat.
- In a large bowl, combine arugula, red onion, radishes, and fresh herbs. Drizzle with the dressing and toss to coat.
- Distribute arugula mixture between 2 plates or bowls. Arrange 3 asparagus stalks on top of each mound of salad.
- To poach the egg, bring 3 to 4 inches of water to a boil in the saucepan and add 2 tablespoons of distilled white vinegar. Turn the heat on the stove down to low until the water is barely bubbling and keep it that way throughout the poaching process. Break the eggs into a ramekin one at a time making sure not to break the yolk. With a long-handled spoon, gently stir the water in a circular motion to create a gentle whirlpool. While the water is still gently swirling, carefully add the eggs to the water, cooking no more than 2 at a time. Cook for 3 minutes, gently nudging the eggs with a spoon to keep the whites close to the yolk. When the eggs are done, the whites should be firm.
- When the eggs are ready, remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon and lightly pat them with a paper towel if necessary to remove excess water. Place them over the asparagus spears and grind some fresh black pepper on top.
