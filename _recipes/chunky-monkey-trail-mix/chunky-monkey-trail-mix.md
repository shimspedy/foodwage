ingredients:
- Chunky Monkey Trail Mix:

- 0.5|  cup  raw almonds
- 0.25|  cup  unsweetened coconut flakes
- 0.25|  cup  banana chips
- 0.25|  cup  peanut butter chips  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 0.25|  cup  semisweet chocolate chunks or chocolate chips  certified gluten-free if necessary

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Place almonds and coconut on a baking sheet, and bake for about 10 minutes.
- Remove from oven. Allow almonds and coconut to cool a bit before placing in a large mixing bowl. Add in banana chips, peanut butter chips and chocolate chunks. Give the mixture a stir. If the nuts are still a little warm, the chocolate and peanut butter chips will melt and create chunks of trail mix.
- Pour mixture onto parchment paper, and place in the fridge to set up. Remove from fridge, and enjoy. Store any leftovers in an airtight container.
