notes:

ingredients:
- Chicken Tenders:

- 1|  pound  boneless, skinless chicken tenders
- 0.5| cup  plain yogurt  (I used 2% Fage)
- 0.5| tablespoon harissa  (or other hot sauce of your choice; certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 1.5| cups  unsweetened brown rice cereal  (certified gluten-free if necessary)
- 1| teaspoon sesame seeds  toasted
- 0.5| teaspoon dried parsley
- 0.5| teaspoon garlic powder
- 0.5| teaspoon sea salt
- 0.25| teaspoon ground pepper

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Line a baking sheet or stone with parchment and a wire rack.
- In a shallow medium bowl, stir together the yogurt and harissa until well-blended.
- Place the brown rice cereal in a plastic baggie and pound/smash to crush. Once your cereal is crushed add it to a shallow bowl with the sesame seeds, parsley, garlic powder, sea salt and pepper.
- Dredge the chicken tenders in the yogurt mixture, wiping off any access and then dip them into the brown rice cereal mixture. Roll until tender is covered completely. Place the cereal coated tenders on the wire rack on the baking sheet.
- Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown and chicken is completely cooked through.
- Remove tenders from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.
