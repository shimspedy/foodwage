If you like a quick breakfast of scrambled eggs, you’ll love them with slivered, browned Brussels sprouts and savory smoked salmon. This recipe calls for “hot-smoked” chunked salmon, but you could also use smoked lox. Fuel for your day with plenty of protein, and skip the sugary cereals and pastries that lead to the inevitable mid-morning crash.
