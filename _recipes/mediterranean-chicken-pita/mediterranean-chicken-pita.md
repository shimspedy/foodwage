notes:


ingredients:
- For the grilled chicken:

- 0.125|  cup  olive oil  plus more for brushing
- 0.5|  medium  lemon  juiced
- 1|  clove  garlic
- 0.75|  teaspoon  dried oregano
- 0.5|  teaspoon  dried thyme
- 0.125|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.125|  teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
- 1|  pound  boneless, skinless chicken breasts

- For the yogurt sauce:

- 0.5|  cup  plain Greek yogurt, divided
- 0.25|  large  cucumber
- 0.5|  medium  red onion  minced, if desired

directions:
- In a bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, thyme, salt and pepper. Add the chicken breasts, and toss until well-combined. Allow the chicken to marinade for at least 1 hour before grilling.
- Meanwhile, prepare the yogurt sauce. Add the Greek yogurt, cucumber and garlic powder to a food processor, and blend until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to serve. (If you don’t have a food processor, thinly slice the cucumber. Add Greek yogurt and garlic powder. Stir until well-combined.)
- Grill the chicken over a stovetop using a grill pan for 12–15 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Occasionally brush chicken breast with oil to prevent it from getting too dry. If you don’t have a grill pan, grill chicken over a traditional barbecue grill.
- Allow chicken breasts to cool before slicing into large pieces. In the meantime, lightly toast the pita bread.
- Assemble the pita wrap. For each wrap use 1/2 chicken breast, 1 pita, 3 tablespoons yogurt sauce, 1/2 tomato, and 2–3 slices of cucumber. Sprinkle with red onion, if desired.
