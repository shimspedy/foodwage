ingredients:
- Steel-cut Oat Breakfast Risotto With Pea Pesto:

- 2|  tsp  olive oil
- 0.5|  cup  onion  chopped
- 0.5|  cup  steel-cut oats
- 2|  cup  no-salt added chicken or vegetable stock
- 6|  tbsp  shredded Parmesan cheese
- 0.5|  cup  frozen peas  thawed
- 0.25|  cup  fresh basil leaves  packed

directions:
- In a small saucepan, warm the olive oil over medium-high heat.
- Add the onions, and stir until they start to sizzle. Lower the heat to medium-low and stir occasionally for about 10 minutes.
- When the onions are soft and lightly golden, add the oats and stir, increasing the heat to high.
- When the oats are hot, add the stock and bring to a boil.
- Reduce the heat to low and cover. Cook for 25 minutes. Uncover and stir vigorously, then stir in the Parmesan cheese. Remove from heat and let stand. It will continue to thicken.
- While the oats cook, place the peas and basil in the bowl of a food processor. Puree the mixture, scraping down and repeating until a chunky puree is produced.
- When the oats are tender and creamy, stir in the basil and pea puree and serve hot.

If you’re tired of sweets for breakfast, try this comfortingly creamy, savory take on steel-cut oats. It’s got the flavors of Parmesan and fresh basil and even gives you a vegetable with breakfast. You can make the two components the night before, then heat the oats on the stove (or in the microwave) and, when hot, stir in the pesto.
