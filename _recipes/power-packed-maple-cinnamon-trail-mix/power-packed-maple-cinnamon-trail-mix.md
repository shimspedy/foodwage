Store-bought trail mix can be high in added sugar, but Eating Bird Food’s maple-cinnamon trail mix contains only 6 grams of sugar per serving, making it a great choice for breakfast. What’s more, it’s loaded with antioxidants and heart-healthy unsaturated fats. The American Heart Association recommends eating a small handful, or 1.5 ounces of whole nuts, about 4 times per week. This is a tasty way to reach that quota! (Nuts are calorie-dense, so be mindful of portion sizes.)
