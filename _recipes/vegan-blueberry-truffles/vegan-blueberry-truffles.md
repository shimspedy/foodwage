notes:


ingredients:
- Vegan Blueberry Truffles:

- 2|  cup  raw cashews
- 1|  cup  medjool dates  pitted
- 1|  cup  unsweetened dried blueberries
- 0.125|  teaspoon  sea salt
- 1|  teaspoon  vanilla extract
- 1|  teaspoon  water
- 2|  cup  dark chocolate chips
- Sea salt  for garnish

directions:
- Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Then, place cashews in food processor and mix until you’ve created a fine meal.
- Add pitted dates, dried blueberries, salt, vanilla extract and water. Process for 2–3 minutes. You will likely need to stop a few times to scrape the sides. Depending on how soft your dates are, you might need to add 1–2 teaspoons or more water to loosen your dough up a bit. It should be sticky but malleable.
- Using a tablespoon scoop, portion out dough and roll between the palms of your hands to form a ball. Repeat.
- Place chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and melt. Using two forks, dip each blueberry truffle into the chocolate and fully coat. Place on a parchment-lined cookie sheet to set. Repeat with each truffle, then place the cookie sheet in the freezer for at least 1 hour.
