Pasta is an easy and flexible way to make a main meal in one-pot. Thanks to our friends at Cooking Light here’s a pasta recipe featuring budget-friendly diced tomatoes and spinach. If you’re not into this combo then try some of these riffs:

Riff 1: Use fresh grape tomatoes instead, and add fresh herbs.

Riff 2: Swap out spaghetti for any short pasta shape, such as elbow macaroni, rotini, or shells.

Riff 3: Try adding chopped skinless, boneless chicken thighs, ground beef, or ground turkey for a heartier dish.
