ingredients:
- Gorgeously Green Spring Pasta:

- 1|  box  Barilla® ProteinPLUS® penne pasta
- 0.75|  cup  walnuts
- 0.5|  cup  fresh breadcrumbs  or panko
- 2|  lemons zest
- 2|  tablespoon  fresh parsley  chopped
- 3|  tablespoon  olive oil
- 1|  medium leek  thinly sliced
- 1|  bunch  asparagus  cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1.5 cups)
- 2|  cup  fresh (or frozen) spring peas
- 1|  large zucchini  julienned
- 0.5|  teaspoon  salt
- 0.25|  teaspoon  ground pepper
- 2|  tablespoon  fresh mint  chopped
- 2|  tablespoon  fresh basil  chopped

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400˚F.
- Spread walnuts on a small sheet pan and place in the oven for 5–8 minutes or until lightly toasted. In a food processor, pulse together bread crumbs, walnuts and zest of one lemon. Pour into a medium dish and toss with parsley and a pinch of salt. Set aside.
- Prepare pasta according to package directions. Cook to al dente and drain, reserving one cup of the cooking water.
- While pasta is cooking, pour olive oil into a large sauté pan. Add leeks and asparagus, and saute over medium heat for about 4 minutes until they start to soften. Add peas, zucchini, salt and pepper. Sauté another 5 minutes until all of the vegetables are slightly softened. Add zest of second lemon and reserved cooking water and stir gently until combined.
- Return pasta to cooking pot. Add vegetables to pasta and toss to combine. Gently stir in mint and basil. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed.
- Top with 2 tablespoons of the walnut mixture and serve.
