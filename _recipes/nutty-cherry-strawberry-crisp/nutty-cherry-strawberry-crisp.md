ingredients:
- Crumble:

- 0.5| cup  gluten-free rolled oats
- 0.25| cup  gluten-free all-purpose flour  such as Cup4Cup or Bob’s Red Mill brands
- 0.25| cup  salted roasted almonds  chopped
- 0.25| cup  unsweetened shredded coconut
- 2| tablespoons  light brown sugar
- 0.5| teaspoon  ground cinnamon
- 0.25| teaspoon  kosher salt
- 0.25| cup  melted coconut oil

- Filling:

- 2| cups  Bing cherries  pitted
- 2| cups  hulled strawberries  halved if large
- 2| tablespoons  gluten-free all-purpose flour
- 1| tablespoon  light brown sugar
- 1| teaspoon  almond extract
- 0.25| teaspoon  kosher salt
- to taste  Coconut milk yogurt  Optional, for serving
directions:
- For the crumble: In a medium bowl, mix the oats with the flour, almonds, coconut, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Pour the melted coconut oil over the top and toss to coat. Refrigerate while you assemble the filling.
- For the filling: Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or 1.5-quart baking dish. In a large bowl, combine the filling ingredients. Scrape into the prepared skillet and smooth to evenly distribute.
- Break the chilled crumble into small chunks and scatter over the fruit. Bake for 50 minutes–1 hour or until the fruit is very juicy and tender and the crumble is crisp and golden brown. Let cool for 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature with a dollop of coconut milk yogurt.

This gluten- and dairy-free fruit crisp is best made when cherries and strawberries are at their juicy peak in mid-summer. Depending on the ripeness of your fruit, adjust the amount of sugar in the filling. To get those ideal crunchy clumps of crumble on top, let the mixture chill in the refrigerator for 20–30 minutes so the coconut oil hardens. Then, break off chunks of oats, nuts and coconut and arrange them over the fruit.
Pro tip: Save a little for breakfast the next morning — just flip the yogurt-to-crisp ratio and kick off your day right.
