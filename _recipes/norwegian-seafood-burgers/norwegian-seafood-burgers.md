directions:
- Pulse the bread in a food processor until finely ground, pour into a large bowl. Add the fish, scallops and shrimp to the food processor and pulse until finely ground, about 20 on/off pulses. Transfer to the bowl with the breadcrumbs and add the green onions, dill, mayonnaise, egg, salt and pepper. Stir well to combine. With moistened hands, form the mixture into 4 patties about 4.5 inches in diameter. Chill for 10 minutes.
- Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the burgers and cook without moving them until golden brown underneath and set on the sides, 5 minutes. Carefully flip the burgers, reduce heat to medium low and cook on the second side until the mixture is opaque in the center, about 5 minutes. Tuck the burgers into the lettuce leaves and serve with lemon wedges on the side.

These juicy seafood burgers are packed with protein and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. We tuck them into lettuce leaves, but you could easily put them on a whole-grain bun. The burgers freeze well, so you may want to make a double batch and freeze some for later; defrost overnight in the fridge before cooking.
