ingredients:
- protein ball:

- 1.5| cup old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1| cup cashew butter
- 0.25| cup honey
- 2| scoops vanilla protein powder
- 2| tbsp raisins
- 0.25| tsp cinnamon

directions:
- Place oats, cashew butter, honey, protein powder, raisins and cinnamon in a large bowl and stir to combine.
- Getting the mixture to combine takes a little arm muscle and it may seem a little crumbly at first, but it will come together as you keep mixing. Use your hands to knead the dough near the end.
- Once combined, use a small cookie scoop to scoop and form the dough into balls.
- Store in a covered container in the fridge or freezer.
