Fun and fiery are not usually words you’d use to describe soup but Cooking Light’s recipe for tortilla soup with shrimp and avocado is another story! The recipe calls for chipotle chili and fire-roasted tomatoes to lend extra spiciness and smokiness. Puffy, chewy hominy kernels add texture (and fiber) to the dish without weighing it down in extra calories and fat. Fun fact: hominy is dried corn soaked in limewater until it is tender. This process also releases niacin, an important B-vitamin.
