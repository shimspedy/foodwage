ingredients:
- For the dip:

- 2|  tsp  olive oil
- 1|  small shallot  finely chopped
- 2|  tsp  fresh thyme  chopped
- 1|  tsp  garlic  finely chopped
- 8|  cup  baby spinach
- 1|  cup  frozen artichokes,  defrosted, patted dry and chopped
- 0.33333333333|  cup  canned, sliced water chestnuts  drained and chopped
- 1|  cup  2% Greek yogurt
- 0.75|  cup  Neufchatel cheese (or reduced-fat cream cheese), at room temperature
- 1.5|  tsp  lemon zest
- 0.5|  tsp  salt
- 0.25|  tsp  pepper
- 1|  cup  part-skim mozzarella  grated

- For the chips:

- 3|  whole-grain pocket breads  such as Ezekiel
- 2|  tsp  olive oil
- 0.25|  tsp  smoked paprika
directions:
- For the dip - Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Heat the oil in medium sauté pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until tender, 2 minutes. Add the thyme and garlic and sauté until fragrant, 20 seconds. Add the spinach and toss with tongs until wilted, 3 minutes. Place in a strainer and squeeze out the excess moisture. Chop and set aside.
- For the dip - In a medium bowl, beat the yogurt, Neufchatel cheese, lemon zest, salt and pepper until blended. Add the spinach mixture, artichokes, water chestnuts and half the mozzarella cheese and stir with a spoon until blended. Transfer to a 4-quart baking dish. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake, uncovered, until bubbly, 30–35 minutes. (The unbaked dip can be covered and kept in the refrigerator for up to two days before baking.)
- For the chips - Brush both sides of the pocket breads with the oil. Cut the breads in half, open them up into pockets, and then peel the 2 sides apart to make 2 thinner pieces of bread. Cut each piece into 5 wedges. Repeat with remaining pitas. Arrange pita wedges on a baking sheet in a single layer and sprinkle with paprika. Bake until crispy and golden brown, 15 minutes. Serve the warm dip with the pita chips

We’ve made this typically rich appetizer lighter by upping the vegetables and using protein-rich Greek yogurt and reduced-fat Neufchatel cheese. Making homemade whole-grain pita chips is as easy as slicing bread; try this method once — and you’ll never buy the high-sodium, bagged chips again.
