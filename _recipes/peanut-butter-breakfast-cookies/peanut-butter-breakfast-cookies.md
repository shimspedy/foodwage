notes:


ingredients:
- Peanut Butter Breakfast Cookies:

- 2|  large  ripe bananas  140 grams each
- 2|  large  eggs  50 grams each
- 2.5|  cup  rolled oats  certified gluten-free if necessary
- 1|  cups  peanut butter
- 3|  tablespoon  honey
- 3|  tablespoon  cinnamon
- Pinch of salt

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray.
- Add the ripe bananas and eggs into a medium mixing bowl. Mix with a spatula, mashing on the banana to get chunks as small as possible. Add the oats, peanut butter, honey, and salt, and stir until just combined. The mixture will get thick and hard to stir.
- Use a 1/4 cup measure to portion cookie dough into 12 balls. Take each ball and split it in half to create 24 smaller balls. Roll each ball and lightly smash it between your palms to create a mini cookie.
- Place the cookies on the baking sheet. Bake until the edges start to brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
